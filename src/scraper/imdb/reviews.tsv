/title/tt1561457/	Double Down	1/10	A Tour De Force of Epic Nothingness	\nWhat to say about this movie, nothing really. After watching this I was\nconfused and wondered exactly what the heck I had just seen, and if I\nhad actually watched a movie or just some scenes hastily spliced\ntogether. The plot is lack luster, the acting is sub par, the\ncontinuity of the story is not there. Changing from one scene the the\nnext with barely, if any continuity. The video quality was below what\nwould be expected even for an independent film. It is apparent that\nthis movie was written as a ego-stroking for the write/director/star.I am sure that Neil Breen had a story in mind at the beginning but\nsomewhere between what he had envisioned to the final product that idea\ntook a turn for the worse. Leaving us with a hallow, unfilled piece of\ncinematic nothingness.\n
/title/tt1641398/	Little Gobie	1/10	Hongkong drops the animation ball	\nThe first Toy Story type animation to come out of Hongkong was Dragon\nBlade which was a terrific movie, really using the talent Hongkong has\nin martial arts to tell a solid family story. This was continued with\nthe success of TMNT, again having great action in it. Now Astro Boy\nmight not have been as successful as TMNT, but it was certainly great\nentertainment. I loved that movie!!! So when Little Gobie came out as\nthe next Hongkong made computer animated film I was more than eager to\nsee it. But it was really really REALLY REALLY R E A L L Y bad. OMG,\ndidn't the director see any of the other animated films made by his\nfellow countrymen??? What was on the mind of the people who paid to\nmake this movie??? Do ANY of them watch any moves at all??? All I can\nsay is, thank GOD I went alone to watch this (and the theater was\npretty empty too). I guess people can sense a stinker. Well, from now\non I'm gonna be a little more careful before choosing to watch an\nanimated movie made in Hongkong!\n
/title/tt0208065/	The Colour of Funny	10/10	Rib tickler	\n\nThis is one of the funniest films I've ever seen.  My ribs were tickled\nfrombeginning to end.  With a real talent for comedy the creators of this film\nshould\nbe proud of their achievements.  I really enjoyed it and can thoroughlyrecommend a viewing - particularly if you need a 'cheer me up'\nmoment.\n
/title/tt0208065/	The Colour of Funny	1/10	Oh sweet moses no.	\n\nIn a lifetime, everyone exposes themselves to the risk of seeing a\ntremendously bad film. It's a risk we have to take, because some of the\nbest\nfilms, are often underrated or laughed at by some people. However, the\nbest\nthing about this film is the title, a weak and tenuous pun, but non the\nless, enough to raise a smile if only for kitsch value. Please beware of\nthis film, it's indescribably bad. Go read a book.\n
/title/tt1346259/	Dead & Nowhere	1/10	The longest 85-minute movie ever	\nThis movie is terrible. The opening scene has a hooker getting killed.\nAnd then we get the cliché scene of a homeless guy finding the body -\nwhich is still in the killer's car. Hello, big clue - killer's car. But\ninstead of talking about that, the cops who arrive on the scene talk\nabout how they would have liked to have had sex with the hooker. One of\nthe cops says the hooker was in the wrong place at the wrong time.\nWhat? It's the same place and the same time as always. I mean, she's a\nhooker. Hello? Anyway, our main character is a priest/cab driver who\nlikes to preach to the hookers for an hour every night at a fast food\njoint. I thought the hookers were transvestites at first, so for a\nmoment I was interested. But it turns out they're just ugly women. That\nscene outside the food joint is insanely long, but really every single\nscene in this film goes on much too long. We're introduced in that\nscene to Bob, some security guy outside a plant who wants the priest to\nask the whores not to hook near the plant anymore because he might lose\nhis job. What? Who cares? Anyway, the main cop character thinks it's\nthe priest who is the killer, so he follows him around, and even enters\nhis apartment without a warrant - and he uses his flashlight, even\nthough the lamp is on right next to him. The cops for one scene decide\nto hide in a van near the hookers in case the killer comes. For some\nreason their surveillance cameras can only pick up the girls feet and\nlegs. We have lots and lots of shots of their boots - apparently the\ndirector's fetish. And about a half hour in, we suddenly get narration\nby the main cop character for no reason - and again two other times,\nand again for no reason. Anyway, near the end, when we find out who the\nkiller is, the killer actually says something about his Mommy once\ntelling him he wasn't allowed to talk to any other women but her. Ugh.\nSo it's the killer's Mommy's fault. Of course it is. Who cares? At\nfirst this movie is so bad that it's funny. I was laughing out loud for\nthe first twenty minutes or so, but then it just drags and drags, and\nyou just want every character to get killed so the bloody thing can be\nover. But this movie really has no other murders, at least not by the\nkiller. And for a film with a lot of whores, we don't even get any\ngratuitous nudity, apart from that shot at the very beginning, and even\nthat is through the car's windshield. I mean, hell, the filmmakers\ncould have least given us that, since they weren't giving us anything\nelse.\n
/title/tt0206910/	Mafia Connection	1/10	Karin Schubert goes hardcore	\n\nUnless you have a penchant for fisting or golden showers, this film serves\nonly as a curiosity in that it features former softcore/pseudo-mainstream\nactress, Karin Schubert performing in a hardcore sex scene.  Note: She\ndoes\nnot engage in any of the nasty aforementioned acts.  Just straight\nsex.\n
/title/tt1690519/	Sto xespasma tou feggariou	1/10	Beware of the moon (or this movie)	"\nLet me start off by giving this movie the credit its due to get. It\nstays true to itself from beginning til the end. And while I am\nanything but a fan of telenovelas, shouldn't I have known, what I let\nmyself into? Let me clarify this, as stated at some of my other\nreviews, I do not read anything about movies I'm about to see. And\nsince I was in Greece I wanted to watch a few movies that were made\nthere to get a sense of the film culture.The good, the bad and the ugly ... this could be categorized in the\nlatter two. The actors might look good, but is that what you look for\nin ""actors""? Suffice to say, that they probably had a great time\nshooting this, but when ""feelings"" get beat into your head, nausea is\nthere to engulf you ...When our two main ... people meet and see each other eye-to-eye, you\nget a slow motion scene that will haunt you for the rest of the movie\n(quite literally at times). And while the telenovela audience might not\nhave a problem with the cliché ridden story, this is something that\nshould never have ""graced"" the big screen. It is too easy to trash this\nmovie (for obvious reasons) ... so I will stop here. The brother and\none of the fathers seemed to bring some quality into this ... but it\nnever happened. Goes to show you though, that with bad directing (and\nscript) even performances cannot overshadow that ...\n"
/title/tt1434941/	Sure Looks Good	7/10	True film about the situations we as women can put ourselves in...And friends to get you out!	"\nI liked this film. I actually came across it on a message board. I\nfigured I'd watch it out of boredom, and I was pleasantly surprised.\nIt's sort of like the hood version of ""Waiting to Exhale"". But don't\nthink its a movie JUST for black women, because I really think any\nwoman of any race can relate.Maybe I enjoyed it because it was shot in Philadelphia ( My home away\nfrom home) or maybe it was because I saw myself in each of the women.\nSome of the acting needed work, but you can definitely get passed that.\nThe ladies were enjoyable, and the message is friendship is everything.\nYou can get through anything with your girls holding you down!\n"
/title/tt1434941/	Sure Looks Good	9/10	4 different women.... 4 unique stories	\nCan you count on your friends through thick and thin? Better yet, who\ndo you run to when you feel like you're carrying the weight of the\nworld on your shoulders? I had the chance to review Sure Looks Good\nfrom Maverick Entertainment Group and it showed me that there's no\nproblem too big for your friends to help you solve.While much of the storyline felt somewhat familiar, there is something\nspecial about this film. It takes us through the lives of four\ndifferent women as they try to deal with motherhood, personal\nstruggles, relationships, and more. This is a movie that exemplifies\nthe true meaning of friendship. April, Pam, Sharon, and Simone each\nhave their own vice they are trying to overcome. Whether it's a sexual\naddiction, cheating, bad parenting, or lack of spousal support, their\nloyalty to one another cannot be questioned.Sure Looks Good is a romantic drama that exploits good friends as they\nidentify those obstacles and overcome them together. What struck me the\nmost was how the film combined a little bit of everything from drama,\ncomedy, and romance. It offered a lot more than I expected. You not\nonly care about the characters in this film, you actually see them grow\nup on screen.Though the cast was all African American actors, this is movie for all\nethnic backgrounds. Anyone can relate to the issues these women are\nfacing.\n
/title/tt0464996/	Kibris: La ley del equilibrio	1/10	Worst movie ever about vampires	\nI think it is the worst movie I ever seen. It has a lot of errors, a\nreally bad sound and a horrible performance of the actors. It seems\nthat a kid about 13 years old will do a better movie, maybe it would be\nbetter if it was directed by a child.The film is about vampires. A half of vampires want to destroy the\nhuman race to have the power in the world. Other vampires will fight\nagainst his own race in order to remain the balance of the good and the\nbad forces.I am not sure about what mythology used in the movie. They use some of\nthe Dracula mythology but it seems that they had invented a lot and a\nlot of new things about vampires. It looks so bad.\n
/title/tt0464996/	Kibris: La ley del equilibrio	1/10	one of the worst movies in last 30 years...in more than 4 different genres!!!!!!

Probably not.Laughably bad masked hero film has lots of capes, home movie level\nprops and an intelligence level that is beyond low. I watched this\nhorrified that anyone would have put this into theaters and expected\npeople to pay for it. I mean the ray gun used by some of the bad guys\nis clearly a child's toy.It's awful, I mean really bad.Yes it's unintentionally funny, but there aren't enough laughs to\njustify what will amount to 80 minutes of your life wasted.avoid.\n
/title/tt0191989/	The End of a Dynasty	1/10	The 1 out of 10 user rating is well deserved	\nI approached this short with some hope of gaining fun insight into the\nKennedy assassination. After eleven minutes I am more stupider than\nbefore and Scythe contract-player George Thompson has elevated from\nnumber 6 to 3 on my sh!t list. Opening with a killer title sequence\nthat cruelly tricks its human viewers into thinking they're in for a\nEuro slice of heaven, we are quickly transported to hellhole-nowhere\nFairbanks where a bunch of teens pose, masquerade and giggle like\ncomplacent Calvin Klein modelsonly with acne, frizzy hair, visible\nbody odor and, in the case of one poor fat slob, the girth of a\nVolkswagen. Pretentiously divided like chapters from a book, this film\n(ahem) chronicles each Kennedy death with as much visual panache and\naudio creativity as a public access show run by heavy metal\njournalists. One particularly flinching scene has a teen injecting\nheroin into his veins. What is the point of this nonsense? Has director\nMike A. Martinez lost his marbles? Why must serious issues such as drug\nuse and public assassinations be treated with such indignity and\ncarelessness? And scientists wonder why our society is so corrupted and\nill-informed. Powerful cameo by the director shooting dry rounds of a\ncap gun into JFK and subsequently fleeing the scene like a robotic\nscarecrow with a stick in his ass.Unfortunately, the outtakes have been edited into the movie. Yes folks,\nfor the first time ever, a movie has included its outtakes as actual\ncuts in the final film, and while credit must be given to the editor\nfor brazenly adopting such a controversial technique, it becomes\ntiresome and overstayed once we see it for 80 percent of the movie (it\nshould also be pointed out they're not funny either). Also not funny is\nthe condescending plot narration and convoy of mini-vans posing as\nautomobiles in 1963 (apparently it snows in Texas, too). What is funny\nis the direction, writing, wardrobe, lighting and sex life for all the\nactors in the movie.\n
/title/tt0198000/	Venice Bound	9/10	A strong imaginative film without the Hollywood gloss	"\n\nThis film was an interesting display of how ingenuity can outshine\nHollywood's sometimes overabundance of money. While obviously shot on a\nshoestring budget, this clever caper movie for Generation X has an\nhonesty and grit to it that makes it far more memorable than the usual\nHollywood fare. Each of the three main characters stands out\ndramatically from one another, and yet there is no suspension of\ndisbelief required that they can all share the same goals, however\nbriefly. It's worth it to stay with this one until the characters all\nmeet as the story takes on a new dimension from this point on. Produced\nbefore ""Pulp Fiction"", this is an example of how modern filmmakers of\nthe world use experimental structure to their story's advantage.\n\n"
/title/tt0198000/	Venice Bound	9/10	Wonderful, lo-fi Gen-X storytelling.	"\n\nSeeing this film was a pleasant surprise at the Hamburg Film Festival back\nin '95-96.

Back when it was o.k. to be a drifter, find\nyourself, or just be weird.\nMore than specifics about the film, I remember being interested,\nengrossed,\nvindicated while watching it.

/title/tt0413051/	No Longer My Twin	1/10	Horrible	"\nThis is absolutely the worst video I have ever watched. The editing,\nlighting, camera work, acting... All are horrible. This film has\ncreated a new genre for itself... It is so bad that it is not even\nfunny. There is absolutely no continuity in this film at all. The main\nactress walks out of her house, and it is winter time, 20 seconds\nlater, she walks into the forest in the middle of summer, with green\nleafy trees LOL. This film ""stars"" Robert G. Christie. He basically\nruins the entire movie. I would normally suggest aspiring\nactors/directors/DPs to watch a poor film like this to ensure they\nunderstand what the basics Don't'S are... This film is so bad, that you\ncan't even get a laugh out of it. Well, in the end the ""lead"" ""actor""\nRobert G. Christie puts on a stellar performance as he runs through a\ncemetery wearing his old clothes and Velcro sneakers.I was tricked into believing this film was a Supernatural Thriller\nabout a woman who's dead twin comes back to haunt her. It turns out,\nthis film is about her husband, Robert G. Christie and how he is\nsoooooo desirable that the spirits were never chasing his wife, they\nwere actually after him.This movie is a sad look into the painful and often misleading world of\nclinical Narcissists.""He wears a sadness""\n"

This same man (or unidentified as either sex) keeps bashing\nother people's efforts to do something creative and different with\ntheir talent & time. No Longer My Twin was Christie's first feature\nfilm and as with most people, you try and you learn. The comments made\nby this person are neither constructive or valuable - he does not offer\nany kind of useful information - only forcing his premature,\ninadequate, uneducated, vengeful, trivial OPINION on everyone else.\nInsult slinging is juvenile and not a talent in itself - just another\nirritant.

No Longer My Twin is no blockbuster, but the idea\nwas interesting and with some work, could be salvaged & re-shot with\nthe appropriate cast & crew. Mr. Christie still has a chance to do a\nwonderful feature film someday, because he will not let anyone destroy\nhis vision; perseverance, determination, and having an open mind are\nkey attributes in this business, and this is something we could all\nbenefit by following this example.

/title/tt0257407/	The Antwerp Killer	1/10	Movie manages to unity people: everyone agrees this is really really awful	"\n\nIt's not easy to find information on The Antwerp Killer. Maybe all those\ninvolved hoped memories of this film would slowly fade away. Bad luck for\nthem as I managed to find a copy of a film most video stores don't (want to)\nown. Ever since I found it, many have either desperately asked me to lend it\nto them (some even reviewed it after viewing - see elsewhere on this page)\nor even more desperately begged me never to show it. At last another movie\nwhere everyone agrees: it's hard to find a bigger turkey. And to prove that\npoint in case you're one of the millions who never saw the film, here are\nsome examples:* The movie opens with a girl who's stabbed by the killer. As the girl (it\nwould be a stretch to call her 'actress') isn't really stabbed, fake blood\nis needed to shoot this scene. The fake blood is hidden in a small bag under\nher blouse and we see her press on her stomach to get the blood out of the\nbag. Okay, but what about the blood dripping out of her mouth? After all the\nscene was shot in a pretty dark alley. Oh, no problem, the 'actress' will\njust turn her head to the camera so we can enjoy the fake blood more.\nSplendid thinking there!* In the second scene (the one after the credits - no use speaking of\nopening or end credits as the same credits are used in the beginning and end\nof the movie) the young man who discovered the body is arrested for doing\nsomething highly suspicious: apparently the people of Antwerp weren't\nallowed to ""walk in dark streets"" at night. See, movies always teach you\nsomething.* Especially if a movie have scenes from news bulletins. But because this\nmovie is evidently no-budget, this scene had to be faked and instead we can\nwatch the heroine watch the news. The camera is placed behind the television\nset and all we see is her watching the news. All we hear is an actor\npretending to be a news journalist. But how can this same actor pretend to\nbe the correspondent too (let's not spend our budget on two voice-over\nactors if one can do the trick)? I'll tell you: by pinching his nose while\nhe's speaking. The effect is staggering and so are the facts: the murdered\ngirl in the news bulletin appears to be 22 in the beginning of the bulletin\nand 24 at the end. Did anyone ever check the script, I\nwonder.* To protect our heroine from the Antwerp Killer, the police decide to lock\nup her in jail for a few nights. She doesn't like the idea and tries to run\naway, which leads to possibly the only movie chase INSIDE a police building.\nThat's right, she runs around chairs and tables. Exciting is one\ndescription, mind-boggling another. * There are plenty of horrible but laughable scenes left in this movie, even\nif it only lasts 51 minutes. And the only reason they got to 51 minutes was\nby inserting a dream sequence of 7 minutes (using almost all the footage\nfrom earlier and later in the movie) and filming 3 minutes of roofs and\nbuildings in Antwerp. Why? To show the killer is somewhere out there. Oh, in\nthat case it makes sense. Ermm.* One more example of another scene that should be added to movie history is\nthe scene at the docks. Before this scene the police officer is on the\nphone, talking to his superior and asks if the superior had heard about the\n'tip off'. Apparently mobsters were going to sell drugs at the docks. Was\nthe officer informed by underground connections? Nope, he read it on page 1\nof the paper. Oh, the good old times when newspapers still told you where\nmobsters would meet! Then it's time for the scene at the docks. We see how\nsomething goes wrong with the transaction (one mobster simply drops the\nsuitcase) and how smooth mobsters are at pulling their guns (one only needed\n3 attempts).""The Antwerp Killer""... let's start lobbying for a DVD\nrelease.\n"
/title/tt0257407/	The Antwerp Killer	1/10	The Antwerp Shame.	\n\nTo be kind to everybody involved in this drab little picture I'll not\nmention their names. What can be said about a film without plot, with a\nscript so abominably awful it should encourage all wannabe screenwriters\nto\nhave a go since whatever they would produce could hardly be worse than\nthis.\nThis Belgian take on the crime/giallo genremovie has some people lying on\nthe ground covered in ketchup after a young man has stabbed them. When the\nblood on the mouth of one lady victim isn't visible enough she turns her\nhead towards the light; a cool thing to do when one considers the fact\nthat\nthere isn't supposed to be any light in the alley where she lies dying.\nThe\nsound balance is non-existent and when microphones are hidden under\nbartables, the 'actors' tend to forget this so a lot of thumping can be\nenjoyed by all. We c
