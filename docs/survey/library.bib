abstract = {Social network analysis takes as its starting point the premise that social life is created primarily and most importantly by relations and the patterns formed by these relations. Social networks are formally defined as a set of nodes (or network members) that are tied by one or more types of relations (Wasserman and Faust, 1994). Because network analysts take these networks as the primary building blocks of the social world, they not only collect unique types of data, they begin their analyses from a fundamentally different perspective than that adopted by individualist or attribute-based social science.},

@article{Das2008,
abstract = {As online social networking emerges, there has been increased in- terest to utilize the underlying social structure as well as the avail- able social information to improve search. In this paper, we focus on improving the performance of information collection from the neighborhood of a user in a dynamic social network. To this end, we introduce sampling based algorithms to quickly approximate quantities of interest from the vicinity of a users social graph. We then introduce and analyze variants of this basic scheme exploring correlations across our samples. Models of centralized and dis- tributed social networks are considered. We show that our algo- rithms can be utilized to rank items in the neighborhood of a user, assuming that information for each user in the network is avail- able. Using real and synthetic data sets, we validate the results of our analysis and demonstrate the efficiency of our algorithms in approximating quantities of interest. The methods we describe are general and can probably be easily adopted in a variety of strategies aiming to efficiently collect information from a social graph.},
