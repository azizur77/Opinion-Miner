@article{Das2008,
abstract = {As online social networking emerges, there has been increased in- terest to utilize the underlying social structure as well as the avail- able social information to improve search. In this paper, we focus on improving the performance of information collection from the neighborhood of a user in a dynamic social network. To this end, we introduce sampling based algorithms to quickly approximate quantities of interest from the vicinity of a users social graph. We then introduce and analyze variants of this basic scheme exploring correlations across our samples. Models of centralized and dis- tributed social networks are considered. We show that our algo- rithms can be utilized to rank items in the neighborhood of a user, assuming that information for each user in the network is avail- able. Using real and synthetic data sets, we validate the results of our analysis and demonstrate the efficiency of our algorithms in approximating quantities of interest. The methods we describe are general and can probably be easily adopted in a variety of strategies aiming to efficiently collect information from a social graph.},

Social networks are formally defined as a set of nodes (or network members) that are tied by one or more types of relations (Wasserman and Faust, 1994). Because network analysts take these networks as the primary building blocks of the social world, they not only collect unique types of data, they begin their analyses from a fundamentally different perspective than that adopted by individualist or attribute-based social science.},

abstract = {We present two methods for determining the sentiment expressed by a movie review. The semantic orientation of a review can be positive, negative, or neutral. We examine the effect of valence shifters on classifying the reviews. We examine three types of valence shifters: negations, intensifiers and diminishers. Negations are used to reverse the semantic polarity of a particular term, while intensifiers and diminishers are used to increase and decrease, respectively, the degree to which a term is positive or negative. The first method classifies reviews based on the number of positive and negative terms they contain. We use the General Inquirer in order to identify positive and negative terms, as well as negation terms, intensifiers, and diminishers. We also use positive and negative terms from other sources, including a dictionary of synonym differences and a very large Web corpus. To compute corpus-based semantic orientation values of terms, we use their association scores with a small group of positive and negative terms. We show that extending the term-counting method with contextual valence shifters improves the accuracy of the classification. The second method uses aMachine Learning algorithm, Support VectorMachines. We start with unigram features and then add bigrams that consist of a valence shifter and another word. The accuracy of classification is very high, and the valence shifter bigrams slightly improve it. The features that contribute to the high accuracy are the words in the lists of positive and negative terms. Previous work focused on either the term-counting method or the Machine Learning method. We show that combining the two methods achieves better results than either method alone.},

abstract = {With the in-depth study of sentiment analysis research, finer-grained opinion mining, which aims to detect opinions on different review features as opposed to the whole review level, has been receiving more and more attention in the sentiment analysis research community recently. Most of existing approaches rely mainly on the template extraction to identify the explicit relatedness between product feature and opinion terms, which is insufficient to detect the implicit review features and mine the hidden sentiment association in reviews, which satisfies (1) the review features are not appear explicit in the review sentences; (2) it can be deduced by the opinion words in its context. From an information theoretic point of view, this paper proposed an iterative reinforcement framework based on the improved information bottleneck algorithm to address such problem. More specifically, the approach clusters product features and opinion words simultaneously and iteratively by fusing both their semantic information and co-occurrence information. The experimental results demonstrate that our approach outperforms the template extraction based approaches.},

abstract = {In the past years we have witnessed Sentiment Analysis and Opinion Mining becoming increasingly popular topics in Information Retrieval and Web data analysis. With the rapid growth of the user-generated content represented in blogs, wikis and Web forums, such an analysis became a useful tool for mining the Web, since it allowed us to capture sentiments and opinions at a large scale. Opinion retrieval has established itself as an important part of search engines. Ratings, opinion trends and representative opinions enrich the search experience of users when combined with traditional document retrieval, by showing more insights about a subject. Opinion aggregation over product reviews can be very useful for product marketing and positioning, revealing the customers’ attitude to a product and its features along different dimensions, such as time, geographical location, and experience. Tracking how opinions or discussions evolve over time can help us identify interesting trends and patterns and better understand the ways that information is propagated in the Internet. In this study, we review the development of Sentiment Analysis and Opinion Mining during the last years, and also discuss the evolution of a relatively new research direction, namely, Contradiction Analysis. We give an overview of the proposed methods and recent advances in these areas, and we try to layout the future research directions in the field.},

Opinion mining attempts to come up with ways to automatically analyse subjectivity expressed in natural language text. Previous research on the topic has shown that the overall subjectivity expressed in a document, such as a customer review, can be assessed with accuracy that is feasible in real-world applications. In this paper, we address the challenge of identification of customer opinions expressed towards specific features of a product, such as service quality and location of a hotel. The paper proposes and investigates a method to recognize the relationships between subjective expressions and references to features of a product. While the method has been evaluated on customer hotel reviews, it can potentially find application also in many tasks where concrete statements need to be extracted from documents on heterogeneous topics such as posts in forums, comments on blogs, or utterances in a chat room.},

Different from most existing opinion mining systems, which recognize opinionated sentences as one-step classification procedure, WIAOpinmine adopts a multi-pass coarse-fine analysis strategy. A base classifier firstly coarsely estimates the opinion of sentences and the document. The obtained document-level and sentence-level opinions are then incorporated in a complex classifier to re-analyze the opinion of sentences to obtain refined sentence and document opinions. The updated opinion features are feed back to the complex classifier to further refine the opinion analysis. Such circles terminate until the analysis results converge. Similar strategy is adopted in sentence-topic relevance estimation. Furthermore, the mutual reinforcement between the analysis of sentence relevance and sentence opinion are integrated in one framework in WIA-Opinmine. Evaluations on NTCIR-7 MOAT Traditional Chinese and Simplified Chinese sides show that WIA-Opinmine achieves the best precisions performance in five subtasks and the best F performance in three subtasks including polarity determination, opinion holder recognition and opinion target recognition. This results show that the proposed framework integrating coarse-fine opinion mining strategy and the mutual reinforcement between the analysis of sentence relevance and sentence opinion is promising.},

abstract = {An appraisal expression is described as a collocation of the polarity word and its modi ed target, which can be considered as an atomic unit expressing an eval- uative stance towards a target. Recognizing appraisal expressions is essential for sentence sentiment classi cation. However, the research of appraisal expression recognition is far from enough. This paper proposes a novel method that uses automatic selected syntactic paths to recognize appraisal expressions. Compared with the previous work, the proposed syntactic path based method has two ad- vantages: 1) it automatically explores syntactic knowledge, and 2) it covers more syntactic relationships between polarity words and targets. Based on these, this paper applies appraisal expressions to sentence sentiment classi cation. A set of novel features based on appraisal expressions, including semantic features, syntac- tic features, lexical features and polarity features, is designed to classify sentiment sentences as positive or negative. Experimental results on the camera and MP3 player domains show that the proposed appraisal expression based method out- performs other sentence sentiment classi cation methods. Moreover, we present a composite classi er to integrate our appraisal expression based feature set and the common-used feature set. Experimental results show that our composite classi er can get a better performance than each of them.},

@article{Turney2010,
abstract = {A journal article is often accompanied by a list of keyphrases, composed of about five to fifteen important words and phrases that capture the articles main topics. Keyphrases are useful for a variety of purposes, including summarizing, indexing, labeling, categorizing, clustering, highlighting, browsing, and searching. The task of automatic keyphrase extraction is to select keyphrases from within the text of a given document. Automatic keyphrase extraction makes it feasible to generate keyphrases for the huge number of documents that do not have manually assigned keyphrases. Good performance on this task has been obtained by approaching it as a supervised learning problem. An input document is treated as a set of candidate phrases that must be classified as either keyphrases or non-keyphrases. To classify a candidate phrase as a keyphrase, the most important features (attributes) appear to be the frequency and location of the candidate phrase in the document. Recent work has demonstrated that it is also useful to know the frequency of the candidate phrase as a manually assigned keyphrase for other documents in the same domain as the given document (e.g., the domain of computer science). Unfortunately, this keyphrase-frequency feature is domain-specific (the learning process must be repeated for each new domain) and training-intensive (good performance requires a relatively large number of training documents in the given domain, with manually assigned keyphrases). The aim of the work described here is to remove these limitations. In this paper, I introduce new features that are conceptually related to keyphrase-frequency and I present experiments that show that the new features result in improved keyphrase extraction, although they are neither domain-specific nor training-intensive. The new features are generated by issuing queries to a Web search engine, based on the candidate phrases in the input document. The feature values are calculated from the number of hits for the queries (the number of matching Web pages). In essence, these new features are derived by mining lexical knowledge from a very large collection of unlabeled data, consisting of approximately 350 million Web pages without manually assigned keyphrases.},

@inproceedings{Stepinski2007,
abstract = {Many online news/blog aggregators like Google, Yahoo and MSN allow users to browse/search many hundreds of news sources. This results in dozens, often hundreds, of stories about the same event. While the news aggregators cluster these stories, allowing the user to efficiently scan the major news items at any given time, they do not currently allow alternative browsing mechanisms within the clusters. Furthermore, their intra-cluster ranking mechanisms are often based on a notion of authority/popularity of the source. In many cases, this leads to the classic power law phenomenon -- the popular stories/sources are the ones that are already popular/authoritative, thus reinforcing one dominant viewpoint. Ideally, these aggregators would exploit the availability of the tremendous number of sources to identify the various dominant threads or viewpoints about a story and highlight these threads for the users. This paper presents an initial limited approach to such an interface: it classifies articles into two categories: fact and opinion. We show that the combination of (i) a classifier trained on a small (140K) training set of editorials/reports and (ii) an interactive user interface that ameliorates classification errors by re-ordering the presentation can be effective in highlighting different underlying viewpoints in a story-cluster. We briefly discuss the classifier used here, the training set and the UI and report on some initial anecdotal user feedback and evaluation.},

abstract = {Current approaches to sentiment analysis utilise sentiment lexicons such as SentiWordNet or Harvard's General Inquirer. Sentiment lexicons are dic- tionaries which associate a word with its sentiment (positive, negative or neutral). There are, however, problems with existing sentiment lexicons; they can contain noisy and inconsistent data (SentiWordNet), they can be quite limited in coverage (General Inquirer) and they are not nely-tuned to particular text types or subject domains. This project's aim is to address such problems by developing a methodology which, given labeled data in a particular domain, will create a sentiment lexicon for that domain. The re- search in this project is concerned with user reviews taken from a database of labelled reviews from the website tripadvisor.ie, but will create a gener- alizable model which can be applied to any domain in creating sentiment lexicon.},

abstract = {In recent years, the number of freely available online reviews is increasing at a high speed. Aspect-based opinion mining technique has been employed to find out reviewers' opinions toward different product aspects. Such finer-grained opinion mining is valuable for the potential customers to make their purchase decisions. Product-feature extraction and categorization is very important for better mining aspect-oriented opinions. Since people usually use different words to describe the same aspect in the reviews, product-feature extraction and categorization becomes more challenging. Manually product-feature extraction and categorization is tedious and time consuming, and practically infeasible for the massive amount of products. In this paper, we propose an unsupervised product-feature categorization method with multilevel latent semantic association. After extracting product-features from the semi-structured reviews, we construct the first latent semantic association (LaSA) model to group words into a set of concepts according to their virtual context documents. It generates the latent semantic structure for each product-feature. The second LaSA model is constructed to categorize the product-features according to their latent semantic structures and context snippets in the reviews. Experimental results demonstrate that our method achieves better performance compared with the existing approaches. Moreover, the proposed method is language- and domain-independent.},

The recent advent of several crowdsourcing platforms such as Amazon’s Mechanical Turk, allowing requesters the access to affordable and rapid results of a global workforce, greatly facilitates the creation of massive training data. Most of the available studies on the effectiveness of crowdsourcing report on English data. We use Mechanical Turk annotations to train an Opinion Mining System to classify Spanish consumer comments. We design three different Human Intelligence Task (HIT) strategies and report high inter-annotator agreement between non-experts and expert annotators. We evaluate the advantages/drawbacks of each HIT design and show that, in our case, the use of non-expert annotations is a viable and costeffective alternative to expert annotations.},

We show the difficulty of this task, motivated by the presence of different possible targets and the large variety of affect phenomena that quotes contain. We evaluate our approaches using annotated quotations extracted from news provided by the EMM news gathering engine. We conclude that a generic opinion mining system requires both the use of large lexicons, as well as specialised training and testing data.},

Recently, significant studies have focused on automatically extracting relations from biomedical corpora. Most existing biomedical relation extractors require manual creation of biomedi-cal lexicons or parsing templates based on domain knowledge. In this study, we propose to use kernel-based learning methods to automatically extract biomedical relations from literature text. We develop a framework of kernel-based learning for biomedical relation extraction. In particular, we modified the standard tree kernel function by incorporating a trace kernel to capture richer contextual information. In our experiments on a biomedi-cal corpus, we compare different kernel functions for biomedical relation detection and classification. Theexperimental results show that a tree kernel outperforms word and sequence kernels for relation detection, our trace-tree kernel outperforms the standard tree kernel, and a composite kernel outperforms individual kernels for relation extraction.},

abstract = {Opinion mining became an important topic of study in recent years due to its wide range of applications. There are also many companies offering opinion mining services. One problem that has not been studied so far is the assignment of entities that have been talked about in each sentence. Let us use forum discussions about products as an example to make the problem concrete. In a typical discussion post, the author may give opinions on multiple products and also compare them. The issue is how to detect what products have been talked about in each sentence. If the sentence contains the product names, they need to be identified. We call this problem entity discovery. If the product names are not explicitly mentioned in the sentence but are implied due to the use of pronouns and language conventions, we need to infer the products. We call this problem entity assignment. These problems are important because without knowing what products each sentence talks about the opinion mined from the sentence is of little use. In this paper, we study these problems and propose two effective methods to solve the problems. Entity discovery is based on pattern discovery and entity assignment is based on mining of comparative sentences. Experimental results using a large number of forum posts demonstrate the effectiveness of the technique. Our system has also been successfully tested in a commercial setting.},

A number of approaches have been proposed for creating such lexicons, but they tend to be computationally expensive, and usually rely on significant manual annotation and large corpora. Most of these methods use WordNet. In contrast, we propose a simple approach to generate a high-coverage semantic orientation lexicon, which includes both individual words and multi-word expressions, using only a Roget-like thesaurus and a handful of affixes. Further, the lexicon has properties that support the Polyanna Hypothesis. Using the General Inquirer as gold standard, we show that our lexicon has 14 percentage points more correct entries than the leading WordNet-based high-coverage lexicon (SentiWordNet). In an extrinsic evaluation, we obtain significantly higher performance in determining phrase polarity using our thesaurus-based lexicon than with any other. Additionally, we explore the use of visualization techniques to gain insight into the our algorithm beyond the evaluations mentioned above.},

Previous approaches to textual affect sensing have employed keyword spotting, lexical affinity, statistical methods, and hand-crafted models. This paper demonstrates a new approach, using large-scale real-world knowledge about the inherent affective nature of everyday situations (such as getting into a car accident) to classify sentences into basic emotion categories. This commonsense approach has new robustness implications. Open Mind Commonsense was used as a real world corpus of 400,000 facts about the everyday world. Four linguistic models are combined for robustness as a society of commonsense-based affect recognition. These models cooperate and compete to classify the affect of text. Such a system that analyzes affective qualities sentence by sentence is of practical value when people want to evaluate the text they are writing. As such, the system is tested in an email writing application. The results suggest that the approach is robust enough to enable plausible affective text user interfaces.},

For anyone interested in understanding net user expectations, such web sites are of major importance because they offer the opportunity to probe huge volume of user generated contents. But to actually bene t from those large amount of data, one has to be able to automatically extract users opinions. This is the challenge we tackle in this paper. Our goal is to exploit the various reviews written by a user in order to compute a model which can then be used to predict the users verdict on a movie. We explore two different methods to extract opinions. The rst one relies on a machine learning technique based on a naive bayesian classi er. The second method consists in applying NLP techniques to process opinions and build dictionaries : those dictionaries are then used to determine the polarity of a comment given the words it may contain. We did apply those two approaches to contents from ixster.com : the results we provide enable us to discern the most appropriate approach for a given set of data.},

abstract = {Interesting points: - Paper proposes using sets of seeds in order to estimate correctly the results obtained after growing the seeds. - It uses a fuzzy logic normalization to produce scores for WordNet adjectives between 0 and 1 - Implies that differentiating between subjective and objective content is the hardest due to fuzzy sentiment boundaries (see citation in red below) Abstract Many of the tasks required for semantic tagging of phrases and texts rely on a list of words annotated with some semantic features. We present a method for extracting sentiment-bearing adjectives from WordNet using the Sentiment Tag Extraction Program (STEP). We did 58 STEP runs on unique non-intersecting seed lists drawn from manually annotated list of positive and negative adjectives and evaluated the results against other manually annotated lists. The 58 runs were then collapsed into a single set of 7, 813 unique words. For each word we computed a Net Overlap Score by subtracting the total number of runs assigning this word a negative sentiment from the total of the runs that consider it positive. We demonstrate that Net Overlap Score can be used as a measure of the words degree of membership in the fuzzy category of sentiment: the core adjectives, which had the highest Net Overlap scores, were identified most accurately both by STEP and by human annotators, while the words on the periphery of the category had the lowest scores and were associated with low rates of inter-annotator agreement. Can be used for citation: the greatest challenge with sentiment tagging of words lies at the boundary between sentiment marked (positive or negative) and sentiment neutral words. The 7\% performance gain (from 66.5\% to 73.4\%) associated with the removal of neutrals from the evaluation set emphasizes the importance of neutral words as a major source of sentiment extraction system errors. Moreover, the boundary between sentiment-bearing (positive or negative) and neutral words in GI-H4 accounts for 93\% of disagreements between the labels assigned to adjectives in GI-H4 and HM by two independent teams of human annotators. The view taken here is that the vast majority of such interannotator disagreements are not really errors but a reflection of the natural ambiguity of the words that are located on the periphery of the sentiment category. we present a dictionary-based Sentiment Tag Extraction Program (STEP) that we use to generate a fuzzy set of English sentiment-bearing words for the use in sentiment tagging systems 1. The proposed approach based on the fuzzy logic Zadeh, 1987) is used here to assign fuzzy sentiment tags to all words in WordNet (Fellbaum, 1998), that is it assigns sentiment tags and a degree of centrality of the annotated words to the sentiment category. This assignment is based on Word-Net glosses. This approach relies both on lexical relations (synonymy, antonymy and hyponymy) provided in WordNet and on the Word-Net glosses. The STEP algorithm starts with a small set of seed words of known sentiment value (positive or negative). This list is augmented during the first pass by adding synonyms, antonyms and hyponyms of the seed words supplied in WordNet. This step brings on average a 5-fold increase in the size of the original list with the accuracy of the resulting list comparable to manual annotations (78\%, similar to HM vs. GI-H4 accuracy) At the second pass, the system goes through all WordNet glosses and identifies the entries that contain in their definitions the sentiment-bearing words from the extended seed list and adds these head words (or rather, lexemes) to the corresponding category positive, negative or neutral (the remainder). A third, clean-up pass is then performed to partially disambiguate the identified WordNet glosses with Brills part-of-speech tagger (Brill, 1995), which performs with up to 95\% accuracy, and eliminates errors introduced into the list by part-of- speech ambiguity of some words acquired in pass 1 and from the seed list. At this step, we also filter out all those words that have been assigned contradicting, positive and negative, sentiment values within the same run. For the purposes of the evaluation we have partitioned the entire HM list into 58 non-intersecting seed lists of adjectives. In order to generate a comprehensive list covering the entire set of WordNet adjectives, the 58 runs were then collapsed into a single set of unique words. Since many of the clearly sentiment-laden adjectives that form the core of the category of sentiment were identified by STEP in multiple runs and had, therefore, multiple duplicates in the list that were counted as one entry in the combined list, the collapsing procedure resulted in a lower-accuracy (66.5\% - when GI-H4 neutrals were included) but much larger list of English adjectives marked as positive (n = 3, 908) or negative (n = 3, 905). The remainder of WordNets 22, 141 adjectives was not found in any STEP run and hence was deemed neutral (n = 14, 328). Establishing the degree of words centrality to the semantic category Through the density of the words relationships with other words by enumerating its semantic ties to other words within the field, and calculating membership scores based on the number of these ties; and Through the degree of word membership ambiguity by assessing the inter-annotator agreement on the word membership in this category In some cases, there was a disagreement between different runs on the sentiment assigned to the word. Such disagreements were addressed by computing the Net Overlap Scores for each of the found words: the total number of runs assigning the word a negative sentiment was subtracted from the total of the runs that consider it positive. Thus, the greater the number of runs fetching the word (i.e., Gross Overlap) and the greater the agreement between these runs on the assigned sentiment, the higher the Net Overlap Score of this word. The zero score was assigned to (a) the WordNet adjectives that were not identified by STEP as bearing positive or negative sentiment 6 and to (b) the words with equal number of positive and negative hits on several STEP runs. Last step: normalize the scores based on a Fuzzy logic function (Zadeh, 1987).},

Crucially, this web-derived lexicon does not require WordNet, part-of-speech taggers, or other language-dependent resources typical of sentiment analysis systems. As a result, the lexicon is not limited to specific word classes – e.g., adjectives that occur in WordNet – and in fact contains slang, misspellings, multiword expressions, etc. We evaluate a lexicon derived from English documents, both qualitatively and quantitatively, and show that it provides superior performance to previously studied lexicons, including one derived from WordNet.},

Second, this algorithm is combined with K-means clustering and support vector machine (SVM) to develop unsupervised text mining approach. We use the proposed text mining approach to group the forums into various clusters. with the center of each representing a hotspot forum within the current time span. The data sets used in our empirical studies are acquired and formatted from Sina sports forums, which spans a range of 31 different topic forums and 220,053 posts. Experimental results demonstrate that SVM forecasting achieves highly consistent results with K-means clustering.

While conventional search engines work well in many situations, it's not sufficient for users to gather such information. The reasons include but are not limited to: 1) the ranking strategy does not incorporate product reviews' inherent characteristics, e.g., sentiment orientation; 2) the snippets are neither indicative nor descriptive of user opinions.

Based on this approach, a system named "Improved Product Review Search (IPRS)" is implemented on the ground of a general search engine. Given a query on a product, our system is capable of: 1) automatically identifying user opinion segments in a whole article; 2) ranking opinions by incorporating both the sentiment orientation and the topics expressed in reviews; 3) generating readable review snippets to indicate user sentiment orientations; 4) easily comparing products based on a visualization of opinions.

abstract = {Recent advances in information retrieval over hyperlinked corpora have convincingly demonstrated that links carry less noisy informa- tion than text. We investigate the feasibility of applying link-based methods in new applications domains. The speci c application we consider is to partition authors into opposite camps within a given topic in the context of newsgroups. A typical newsgroup posting consists of one or more quoted lines from another posting followed by the opinion of the author. This social behavior gives rise to a network in which the vertices are individuals and the links repre- sent responded-to relationships. An interesting characteristic of many newsgroups is that people more frequently respond to a mes- sage when they disagree than when they agree. This behavior is in sharp contrast to the WWW link graph, where linkage is an in- dicator of agreement or common interest. By analyzing the graph structure of the responses, we are able to effectively classify peo- ple into opposite camps.

abstract = {Opinion mining is a process, used for automatic extraction of knowledge from the opinion of others about some particular topic or problem. With the growing availability of online resources on Web and popularity of fast and rich resources of opinion sharing such as online review sites and personal blogs, opinion mining has become an interesting area of research. World Wide Web is a fastest medium for opinion collection from users. Human perception and user opinion has greater potential for knowledge discovery and decision support. In this paper we have presented a survey which covers techniques and methods that promise to enable us to get opinion oriented information from text. This research effort deals with techniques and challenges related to sentiment analysis and opinion mining. We have followed systematic literature review process to conduct this survey. Our focus was mainly on machine learning techniques on the basis of their usage and importance for opinion mining. We have tried to identify most commonly used classification techniques for opinionated documents to assist future research in this area.},

To extract the opinion oriented answers, we need to consider both topic relevance and opinion sentiment issues. Current solutions to this problem are mostly ad-hoc combinations of question topic information and opinion information. In this paper, we propose an Opinion PageRank model and an Opinion HITS model to fully explore the information from different relations among questions and answers, answers and answers, and topics and opinions. By fully exploiting these relations, the experiment results show that our proposed algorithms outperform several state of the art baselines on benchmark data set. A gain of over 10\% in F scores is achieved as compared to many other systems.},

abstract = {Sentiment analysis of weblogs is a challenging problem. Most previous work utilized semantic orientations of words or phrases to classify sentiments of weblogs. The problem with this approach is that semantic orientations of words or phrases are investigated without considering the domain of weblogs. Weblogs contain the author's various opinions about multifaceted topics. Therefore, we have to treat a semantic orientation domain-dependently. In this paper, we present an unsupervised learning model based on aspect model to classify sentiments of weblogs. Our model utilizes domain-dependent semantic orientations of latent variables instead of words or phrases, and uses them to classify sentiments of weblogs. Experiments on several domains confirm that our model assigns domain-dependent semantic orientations to latent variables correctly, and classifies sentiments of weblogs effectively.},

We constructed an affect lexicon using a probabilistic disambiguation technique to measure the usage of violence and hate affects. These techniques facilitate in depth analysis of multilingual content. The proposed approach was evaluated by applying it across 16 U.S. supremacist and Middle Eastern extremist group forums. Analysis across regions reveals that the Middle Eastern test bed forums have considerably greater violence intensity than the U.S. groups.

In this paper, we investigate the challenges the researchers might face with sentence-level opinion detection and have tried to demonstrate them with few examples. Our work also includes annotation of a small set of opinionated sentences by two annotators. These Annotators annotate the sentences by labels Positive or Negative. The results of annotation prove that task of opinion detection on sentence-level is more challenging task than opinion detection on document level. In addition, we also discuss the importance of sentence-level opinion detection. Our work can give a new direction to researchers to think and work on.},

abstract = {The evaluative character of a word is called its semantic orientation. Positive semantic orientation indicates praise (e.g., “honest”, “intrepid”) and negative semantic orientation indicates criticism (e.g., “disturbing”, “superfluous”). Semantic orientation varies in both direction (positive or negative) and degree (mild to strong). An automated system for measuring semantic orientation would have application in text classification, text filtering, tracking opinions in online discussions, analysis of survey responses, and automated chat systems (chatbots). This paper introduces a method for inferring the semantic orientation of a word from its statistical association with a set of positive and negative paradigm words. Two instances of this approach are evaluated, based on two different statistical measures of word association: pointwise mutual information (PMI) and latent semantic analysis (LSA). The method is experimentally tested with 3,596 words (including adjectives, adverbs, nouns, and verbs) that have been manually labeled positive (1,614 words) and negative (1,982 words). The method attains an accuracy of 82.8\% on the full test set, but the accuracy rises above 95\% when the algorithm is allowed to abstain from classifying mild words.},

abstract = {Human Language Technology (HLT) and Natural Language Processing (NLP) systems have typically focused on the "factual" aspect of content analysis. Other aspects, including pragmatics, opinion, and style, have received much less attention. However, to achieve an adequate understanding of a text, these aspects cannot be ignored.The chapters in this book address attitude, affect, and subjective opinion. Various conceptual models and computational methods are presented, including distinguishing attitudes from simple factual assertions; distinguishing between the author's reports from reports of other people's opinions; and distinguishing between explicitly and implicitly stated attitudes. In addition, many applications are described that promise to benefit from the ability to understand attitudes and affect, such as indexing and retrieval of documents by opinion; automatic question answering about opinions; analysis of sentiment in the media and in discussion groups; analyzing client discourse in therapy and counseling; determining relations between scientific texts; generating more appropriate texts; and creating writers' aids. In addition to English texts, the collection includes studies of French, Japanese, and Portuguese texts.The chapters in this book are extended and revised versions of papers presented at the American Association for Artificial Intelligence (AAAI) Spring Symposium on Exploring Attitude and Affect in Text, which took place in March 2004 at Stanford University. The symposium, and the book which grew out it, represents a first foray into this area and a balance among conceptual models, computational methods, and applications.},

abstract = {With the explosion of user-generated web2.0 content in the form of blogs, wikis and discussion forums, the Internet has rapidly become a massive dynamic repository of public opinion on an unbounded range of topics. A key enabler of opinion extraction and summarization is sentiment classification: the task of automatically identifying whether a given piece of text expresses positive or negative opinion towards a topic of interest. Building high-quality sentiment classifiers using standard text categorization methods is challenging due to the lack of labeled data in a target domain. In this paper, we consider the problem of cross-domain sentiment analysis: can one, for instance, download rated movie reviews from rottentomatoes.com or IMBD discussion forums, learn linguistic expressions and sentiment-laden terms that generally characterize opinionated reviews and then successfully transfer this knowledge to the target domain, thereby building high-quality sentiment models without manual effort? We outline a novel sentiment transfer mechanism based on constrained non-negative matrix tri-factorizations of term-document matrices in the source and target domains. We report some preliminary results with this approach.},

Our results show that blog searches have different intents than general web searches, suggesting that the primary targets of blog searchers are tracking references to named entities, and locating blogs by theme. In terms of interest areas, blog searchers are, on average, more engaged in technology, entertainment, and politics than web searchers, with a particular interest in current events. The user behavior observed is similar to that in general web search: short sessions with an interest in the first few results only.},

abstract = {Mining the web for customer opinion on different products is both a useful, as well as challenging task. Previous approaches to customer review classification included document level, sentence and clause level sentiment analysis and feature based opinion summarization. In this paper, we present a feature driven opinion summarization method, where the term ldquodrivenrdquo is employed to describe the concept-to-detail (product class to product-specific characteristics) approach we took. For each product class we first automatically extract general features (characteristics describing any product, such as price, size, design), for each product we then extract specific features (as picture resolution in the case of a digital camera) and feature attributes (adjectives grading the characteristics, as for example high or low for price, small or big for size and modern or faddy for design). Further on, we assign a polarity (positive or negative) to each of the feature attributes using a previously annotated corpus and Support Vector Machines Sequential Minimal Optimization machine learning with the Normalized Google Distance. We show how the method presented is employed to build a feature-driven opinion summarization system that is presently working in English and Spanish. In order to detect the product category, we use a modified system for person names classification. The raw review text is split into sentences and depending on the product class detected, only the phrases containing the specific product features are selected for further processing. The phrases extracted undergo a process of anaphora resolution, Named Entity Recognition and syntactic parsing. Applying syntactic dependency and part of speech patterns, we extract pairs containing the feature and the polarity of the feature attribute the customer associates to the feature in the review. Eventually, we statistically summarize the polarity of the opinions different customers expressed about the product on the - - web as percentages of positive and negative opinions about each of the product features. We show the results and improvements over baseline, together with a discussion on the strong and weak points of the method and the directions for future work.},

However, such service providers release little technical information in order to retain their competitive edge. Reputation management is one particular service under development by several companies just now. It promises the analysis and active management of the public opinion on brand names and products through the targeted placement of information nuggets in the blogosphere. Increasingly, blogs are also employed in corporate environments for communication, organisational learning, and other purposes. The nature of corporate blogs and overall information environments remains to be fully explored, and the applicability of blog mining techniques in such localised ecosystems remains to be tested. However, a variety of exciting tools are conceivable for analysing the state of the blogging environment, for extracting and synthesizing information, and to actively shape communication patterns. All in all, the computational analysis of blogs and overall information environments is an exciting research area, and some commitment in this area may yield innovative techniques and effective tools.},

Then it determines the contextual sentiment score for each clause utilizing grammatical dependencies of words and the prior sentiment scores of the words derived from SentiWordNet and domain specific lexicons. Negation is also delicately handled in this study, for instance, the term "not superb" is assigned a lower negative sentiment score than the term "not good".

abstract = {Opinion mining (OM) is a recent subdiscipline at the crossroads of information retrieval and computational linguistics which is concerned not with the topic a document is about, but with the opinion it expresses. OM has a rich set of applications, ranging from tracking users’ opinions about products or about political candidates as expressed in online forums, to customer relationship management. In order to aid the extraction of opinions from text, recent research has tried to automatically determine the “PN-polarity” of subjective terms, i.e. identify whether a term that is a marker of opinionated content has a positive or a negative connotation. Research on determining whether a term is indeed a marker of opinionated content (a subjective term) or not (an objective term) has been, instead, much more scarce. In this work we describe SENTIWORDNET, a lexical resource in which eachWORDNET synset s is associated to three numerical scores Obj(s), Pos(s) and Neg(s), describing how objective, positive, and negative the terms contained in the synset are. The method used to develop SENTIWORDNET is based on the quantitative analysis of the glosses associated to synsets, and on the use of the resulting vectorial term representations for semi-supervised synset classification. The three scores are derived by combining the results produced by a committee of eight ternary classifiers, all characterized by similar accuracy levels but different classification behaviour. SENTIWORDNET is freely available for research purposes, and is endowed with a Web-based graphical user interface.},

abstract = {The problem addressed in this paper is to predict a user’s numeric rating in a product review from the text of the review. Unigram and n-gram representations of text are common choices in opinion mining. However, unigrams cannot capture important expressions like “could have been better”, which are essential for prediction models of ratings. N-grams of words, on the other hand, capture such phrases, but typically occur too sparsely in the training set and thus fail to yield robust predictors. This paper overcomes the limitations of these two models, by introducing a novel kind of bag-of-opinions representation, where an opinion, within a review, consists of three components: a root word, a set of modifier words from the same sentence, and one or more negation words. Each opinion is assigned a numeric score which is learned, by ridge regression, from a large, domain-independent corpus of reviews. For the actual test case of a domain-dependent review, the review’s rating is predicted by aggregating the scores of all opinions in the review and combining it with a domaindependent unigram model. The paper presents a constrained ridge regression algorithm for learning opinion scores. Experiments show that the bag-of-opinions method outperforms prior state-of-the-art techniques for review rating prediction.},

abstract = {Many approaches to automatic sentiment analysis begin with a large lexicon of words marked with their prior polarity (also called semantic orientation). However, the contextual polarity of the phrase in which a particular instance of a word appears may be quite different from the word's prior polarity. Positive words are used in phrases expressing negative sentiments, or vice versa. Also, quite often words that are positive or negative out of context are neutral in context, meaning they are not even being used to express a sentiment. The goal of this work is to automatically distinguish between prior and contextual polarity, with a focus on understanding which features are important for this task. Because an important aspect of the problem is identifying when polar terms are being used in neutral contexts, features for distinguishing between neutral and polar instances are evaluated, as well as features for distinguishing between positive and negative contextual polarity. The evaluation includes assessing the performance of features across multiple machine learning algorithms. For all learning algorithms except one, the combination of all features together gives the best performance. Another facet of the evaluation considers how the presence of neutral instances affects the performance of features for distinguishing between positive and negative polarity. These experiments show that the presence of neutral instances greatly degrades the performance of these features, and that perhaps the best way to improve performance across all polarity classes is to improve the system's ability to identify when an instance is neutral.},

abstract = {Keyphrases are useful for a variety of purposes, including summarizing, indexing, labeling, categorizing, clustering, highlighting, browsing, and searching. The task of automatic keyphrase extraction is to select keyphrases from within the text of a given document. Automatic keyphrase extraction makes it feasible to generate keyphrases for the huge number of documents that do not have manually assigned keyphrases. A limitation of previous keyphrase extraction algorithms is that the selected keyphrases are occasionally incoherent. That is, the majority of the output keyphrases may fit together well, but there may be a minority that appear to be outliers, with no clear semantic relation to the majority or to each other. This paper presents enhancements to the Kea keyphrase extraction algorithm that are designed to increase the coherence of the extracted keyphrases. The approach is to use the degree of statistical association among candidate keyphrases as evidence that they may be semantically related. The statistical association is measured using web mining. Experiments demonstrate that the enhancements improve the quality of the extracted keyphrases. Furthermore, the enhancements are not domain-specific: the algorithm generalizes well when it is trained on one domain (computer science documents) and tested on another (physics documents).},

Specific feature extraction components are integrated to account for the linguistic characteristics of Arabic. The entropy weighted genetic algorithm (EWGA) is also developed, which is a hybridized genetic algorithm that incorporates the information-gain heuristic for feature selection. EWGA is designed to improve performance and get a better assessment of key features. The proposed features and techniques are evaluated on a benchmark movie review dataset and U.S. and Middle Eastern Web forum postings. The experimental results using EWGA with SVM indicate high performance levels, with accuracies of over 91\% on the benchmark dataset as well as the U.S. and Middle Eastern forums. Stylistic features significantly enhanced performance across all testbeds while EWGA also outperformed other feature selection methods, indicating the utility of these features and techniques for document-level classification of sentiments.},

The most salient clues about attitude are provided by the lexical choice of the writer but, as discussed below, the organization of the text also contributes information relevant to assessing attitude. We argue that the current work in this area that concentrates mainly on the negative or positive attitude communicated by individual terms (Edmonds \& Hirst 2002; Hatzivassiloglou and McKeown 1997; Turney \& Littman 2002; Wiebe et al. 2001, In Press) is incomplete and often gives the wrong results when implemented directly.

abstract = {This paper studies sentiment analysis of conditional sentences. The aim is to determine whether opinions expressed on different topics in a conditional sentence are positive, negative or neutral. Conditional sentences are one of the commonly used language constructs in text. In a typical document, there are around 8\% of such sentences. Due to the condition clause, sentiments expressed in a conditional sentence can be hard to determine. For example, in the sentence, if your Nokia phone is not good, buy this great Samsung phone, the author is positive about "Samsung phone" but does not express an opinion on "Nokia phone" (although the owner of the "Nokia phone" may be negative about it). However, if the sentence does not have "if', the first clause is clearly negative. Although "if' commonly signifies a conditional sentence, there are many other words and constructs that can express conditions. This paper first presents a linguistic analysis of such sentences, and then builds some supervised learning models to determine if sentiments expressed on different topics in a conditional sentence are positive, negative or neutral. Experimental results on conditional sentences from 5 diverse domains are given to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach.},

abstract = {Merchants selling products on the Web often ask their customers to share their opinions and hands-on experiences on products they have purchased. Unfortunately, reading through all customer reviews is difficult, especially for popular items, the number of reviews can be up to hundreds or even thousands. This makes it difficult for a potential customer to read them to make an informed decision. The OpinionMiner system designed in this work aims to mine customer reviews of a product and extract high detailed product entities on which reviewers express their opinions. Opinion expressions are identified and opinion orientations for each recognized product entity are classified as positive or negative. Different from previous approaches that employed rule-based or statistical techniques, we propose a novel machine learning approach built under the framework of lexicalized HMMs. The approach naturally integrates multiple important linguistic features into automatic learning. In this paper, we describe the architecture and main components of the system. The evaluation of the proposed method is presented based on processing the online product reviews from Amazon and other publicly available datasets.},

In order to improve the accuracy of the sentiment analysis, it is important to properly identify the semantic relationships between the sentiment expressions and the subject.

In order to realise such a 'sentiment disambiguation', a two stage model is proposed: Identification of domain-specific targets and the construction of a target-specific polarity adjective lexicon.We use Wikipedia for automatic target detection, and a bootstrapping approach to determine the target-specific adjective polarity. It can be shown that our approach outperforms a baseline system that is based on a prior adjective lexicon derived from SentiWordNet.},

Accordingly, extracting the comparative relations about products or services by means of opinion mining techniques could generate significant business values. From the producers perspective, they could better understand the relative strength or weakness of their products, and hence developing better products to meet the consumers requirements. From the consumers perspective, they could exercise more informed purchasing decisions by comparing the various features of certain kind of products. The main contribution of this paper is the development of a novel Support Vector Machine (SVM) based comparative relation map generation method for automatic product features analysis based on the sheer volume of consumer opinions posted on the Web. The proposed method has been empirically evaluated based on the consumer opinions crawled from the Web recently. Our initial experimental results show that the performance of the proposed method is promising, and the precision can achieve 73.15\%.},

At its core, sentiment mining involves correct interpretation of natural language, and all the complexities and challenges involved in such a task. Despite this, the published work on the topic shows a surprising lack of work on the application of natural language based techniques to the problem. This report details an attempt to apply Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques to the problem of accurately classifying the sentiment a document contains relating to a certain subject. Common NLP methods that are implemented in pursuit this goal include part of speech tagging, grammatical structure parsing, and coreference resolution. Combining these NLP approaches gave classification accuracy of 83\% on the test corpus, and suggest with improved coreference resolution handling this could be improved on even further.},

In this paper, we focus on customer reviews of products. In particular, we study the problem of determining the semantic orientations (positive, negative or neutral) of opinions expressed on product features in reviews. This problem has many applications, e.g., opinion mining, summarization and search. Most existing techniques utilize a list of opinion (bearing) words (also called opinion lexicon) for the purpose. Opinion words are words that express desirable (e.g., great, amazing, etc.) or undesirable (e.g., bad, poor, etc) states. These approaches, however, all have some major shortcomings. In this paper, we propose a holistic lexicon-based approach to solving the problem by exploiting external evidences and linguistic conventions of natural language expressions. This approach allows the system to handle opinion words that are context dependent, which cause major difficulties for existing algorithms. It also deals with many special words, phrases and language constructs which have impacts on opinions based on their linguistic patterns. It also has an effective function for aggregating multiple conflicting opinion words in a sentence. A system, called Opinion Observer, based on the proposed technique has been implemented. Experimental results using a benchmark product review data set and some additional reviews show that the proposed technique is highly effective. It outperforms existing methods significantly},

abstract = {A huge number of informal messages are posted every day insocial network sites,blogs,anddiscussion forums. Emotions seem to be frequently important in these texts for expressing friendship, showing social support or as part of online arguments. Algorithms to identify senti- ment and sentiment strength are needed to help under- stand the role of emotion in this informal communication and also to identify inappropriate or anomalous affec- tive utterances, potentially associated with threatening behavior to the self or others. Nevertheless, existing sentiment detection algorithms tend to be commercially oriented, designed to identify opinions about products rather than user behaviors.This article partly fills this gap with a new algorithm, SentiStrength, to extract sentiment strength from informal English text, using new methods to exploit the de facto grammars and spelling styles of cyberspace. Applied to MySpace comments and with a lookup table of term sentiment strengths optimized by machine learning, SentiStrength is able to predict posi- tive emotion with 60.6\% accuracy and negative emotion with 72.8\% accuracy, both based upon strength scales of 15. The former, but not the latter, is better than baseline and a wide range of general machine learning approaches.},

Subjective sentences often contain words which reverse the sentiment polarities of other words. Therefore, interactions between words need to be considered in sentiment classification, which is difficult to be handled with simple bag-of-words approaches, and the syntactic dependency structures of subjective sentences are exploited in our method. In the method, the sentiment polarity of each dependency subtree in a sentence, which is not observable in training data, is represented by a hidden variable. The polarity of the whole sentence is calculated in consideration of interactions between the hidden variables. Sum-product belief propagation is used for inference. Experimental results of sentiment classification for Japanese and English subjective sentences showed that the method performs better than other methods based on bag-of-features.},

abstract = {The boom of product review websites, blogs and forums on the web has attracted many research eﬀorts on opinion min- ing. Recently, there was a growing interest in the ﬁner- grained opinion mining, which detects opinions on diﬀerent review features as opposed to the whole review level. The researches on feature-level opinion mining mainly rely on identifying the explicit relatedness between product feature words and opinion words in reviews. However, the sentiment relatedness between the two objects is usually complicated. For many cases, product feature words are implied by the opinion words in reviews. The detection of such hidden sen- timent association is still a big challenge in opinion mining. Especially, it is an even harder task of feature-level opin- ion mining on Chinese reviews due to the nature of Chinese language. In this paper, we propose a novel mutual rein- forcement approach to deal with the feature-level opinion mining problem. More specially, 1) the approach clusters product features and opinion words simultaneously and it- eratively by fusing both their content information and senti- ment link information. 2) under the same framework, based on the product feature categories and opinion word groups, we construct the sentiment association set between the two groups of data objects by identifying their strongest n senti- ment links. Moreover, knowledge from multi-source is incor- porated to enhance clustering in the procedure. Based on the pre-constructed association set, our approach can largely predict opinions relating to diﬀerent product features, even for the case without the explicit appearance of product fea- ture words in reviews. Thus it provides a more accurate opinion evaluation. The experimental results demonstrate that our method outperforms the state-of-art algorithms.},

abstract = {The American Football betting market provides a particularly attractive domain to study the nexus between public sentiment and the wisdom of crowds. In this paper, we present the first substantial study of the relationship between the NFL betting line and public opinion expressed in blogs and microblogs (Twitter). We perform a large-scale study of four distinct text streams: LiveJournal blogs, RSS blog feeds captured by Spinn3r, Twitter, and traditional news media. Our results show interesting disparities between the first and second halves of each season. We present evidence showing usefulness of sentiment on NFL betting. We demonstrate that a strategy betting roughly 30 games per year identified winner roughly 60\% of the time from 2006 to 2009, well beyond what is needed to overcome the bookie’s typical commission (53\%).},

abstract = {Extracting semantic relationships between entities from text documents is challenging in information extraction and important for deep information processing and management. This paper proposes to use the convolution kernel over parse trees together with support vector machines to model syntactic structured information for relation extraction. Compared with linear kernels, tree kernels can effectively explore implicitly huge syntactic structured features embedded in a parse tree. Our study reveals that the syntactic structured features embedded in a parse tree are very effective in relation extraction and can be well captured by the convolution tree kernel. Evaluation on the ACE benchmark corpora shows that using the convolution tree kernel only can achieve comparable performance with previous best-reported feature-based methods. It also shows that our method significantly outperforms previous two dependency tree kernels for relation extraction. Moreover, this paper proposes a composite kernel for relation extraction by combining the convolution tree kernel with a simple linear kernel. Our study reveals that the composite kernel can effectively capture both flat and structured features without extensive feature engineering, and easily scale to include more features. Evaluation on the ACE benchmark corpora shows that the composite kernel outperforms previous best-reported methods in relation extraction.},

abstract = {A common approach to sentiment analysis is to employ supervised machine-learning methods to acquire prominent features of sentiment. However, the success of these meth- ods is dependent on the domain, topic and time-period represented by the training data. This thesis explores an alternative approach to sentiment analysis, whereby the polarity of text is found by comparing the similarity of its constituents with prototypical examples of positivity and negativity. The techniques proposed are evaluated on various tasks in sentiment analysis and, while they are inferior to well-trained supervised techniques, they perform consistently across different domains, topics and time-periods. The second aspect to this thesis concerns Appraisal, a functional linguistic theory of evaluation in English. The Appraisal theory describes a hierarchy of the language used to communicate evaluation, detailing types of Attitude (how writers communicate their point of view), Engagement (how writers align themselves with respect to the position of others) and Graduation (how writers amplify or diminish their opinions), the recognition of which may assist in performing other tasks in sentiment analysis. The thesis describes the creation of a corpus of book reviews annotated according to the Appraisal theory, and an assessment of the difficulty of performing analyses of Appraisal by way of an inter-annotator agreement study. The corpus is used to evaluate the weakly-supervised methods performance when identifying Appraisal-bearing words. The methods are then used to investigate the application of Appraisal recognition to the broader field of sentiment analysis.},

abstract = {Sentiment analysis concerns about automatically identifying sentiment or opinion expressed in a given piece of text. Most prior work either use prior lexical knowledge defined as sentiment polarity of words or view the task as a text classification problem and rely on labeled corpora to train a sentiment classifier. While lexicon-based approaches do not adapt well to different domains, corpus-based approaches require expensive man- ual annotation effort. In this paper, we propose a novel framework where an initial classifier is learned by incorporating prior information extracted from an existing sentiment lexicon with prefer- ences on expectations of sentiment labels of those lexicon words being expressed using generalized expectation criteria. Documents classified with high confidence are then used as pseudo-labeled examples for automatical domain-specific feature acquisition. The word-class distributions of such self-learned features are estimated from the pseudo- labeled examples and are used to train another classifier by constraining the models pre- dictions on unlabeled instances. Experiments on both the movie-review data and the multi-domain sentiment dataset show that our approach attains comparable or better per- formance than existing weakly-supervised sentiment classification methods despite using no labeled documents.},

Unfortunately, few previous works give comparisons or recommendations among the products. In this paper, we propose an automated system to address this problem. We first build a product feature sentiment database from the reviews. Then we perform the comparison among various products from both subjective and objective perspectives on the feature level. Finally, product recommendations can be suggested according to the previous comparisons and an evolution tree constructed from the reviews. Experiment results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach in mining the digital camera reviews. And now a demo system is put in to practical use.},

The proposed method models the polarity-shifters. Our model can be trained in two different ways: word-wise and sentence-wise learning. In sentence-wise learning, the model can be trained so that the prediction of sentence polarities should be accurate. The model can also be combined with features used in previous work such as bag-of-words and n-grams.

Little work has been done, however, on one aspect of ﬁne-grained opinions – the speciﬁcation and identiﬁcation of opinion topics. In particular, due to the difﬁculty of manual opinion topic annotation, no general-purpose opinion corpus with information about topics of ﬁne-grained opinions currently exists. In this paper, we propose a methodology for the manual annotation of opinion topics and use it to annotate a portion of an existing general-purpose opinion corpus with opinion topic information.

abstract = {A contextual analysis processing technique, consisting in determining the context understanding together with coherences in sentences, of concepts and phenomena related to each others, must be able to simultaneously interpret accurately a sequence of multiple semantic representations. A word frequently carries different meanings according to the context. For example, having a ldquobig heartrdquo is usually understood as a quality, whereas the expression ldquobig wordsrdquo has rather a pejorative connotation. The ldquoevaluation polarityrdquo of a word has a probability of changing considerably according to the context. By applying a semantic analysis of co-occurrence expressions, based on the use of phrases having an absolute evaluation polarity, we developed a system achieving analysis capable of: detecting "the role relations between words", the relationship of meaning in a sentence, identifying transitions in the topic, anaphora, endophora, and analyzing even idiomatic expressions and textual emoticons.

This is useful for consumers who want to research the sentiment of products before purchase, or companies that want to monitor the public sentiment of their brands. There is no previous research on classifying sentiment of messages on microblogging services like Twitter. We present the results of machine learning algorithms for classifying the sentiment of Twitter messages using distant supervision. Our training data consists of Twitter messages with emoticons, which are used as noisy labels. This type of training data is abundantly available and can be obtained through automated means. We show that machine learning algorithms (Naive Bayes, Maximum Entropy, and SVM) have accuracy above 80\% when trained with emoticon data. This paper also describes the preprocessing steps needed in order to achieve high accuracy. The main contribution of this paper is the idea of using tweets with emoticons for distant supervised learning.},

abstract = {Recent reports reveal that users daily consult Web communities opinions for getting an idea about a product/service before they buy it. Furthermore, the same users, freely and without a direct economic return, collaborate in posting new reviews to the community. In most of cases these posts contain an affective content that is needed to explain the meaning of the review, and that is ignored by recent opinion mining techniques. In this work, we propose an affective annotation model of shared reviews, which takes into account the affectivity expressed by the Web community. The annotation model is then used for improving opinion mining results. A case study demonstrating the effectiveness of the approach is also provided. The method can be exploited to better organize the collaborative work of reviews management, and to better take advantage of reviews inside the community.},

In this paper we present new tree kernels over dependency parse trees automatically generated from natural language text. Experiments on a public benchmark data set show that our kernels with richer structural features significantly outperform all published approaches for kernel-based relation extraction from dependency trees. In addition we optimize kernel computations to improve the actual runtime compared to previous solutions.},

As e-commerce is becoming more and more popular, the number of customer reviews a product receives grows rapidly. This makes it difficult for a potential customer to read them to make an informed decision on whether to purchase the product. In this research, we aim to mine customer reviews of a product and extract highly specific product related entities on which reviewers express their opinions. Opinion expressions and sentences are also identified and opinion orientations for each recognized product entity are classified as positive or negative. Different from previous approaches that have mostly relied on natural language processing techniques or statistic information, we propose a novel machine learning framework using lexicalized HMMs. The approach naturally integrates linguistic features, such as part-of-speech and surrounding contextual clues of words into automatic learning. The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach in web opinion mining and extraction from product reviews.},

Automatically mining and organizing opinions from heterogeneous information sources are very useful for individuals, organizations and even governments. Opinion extraction, opinion summarization and opinion tracking are three important techniques for understanding opinions. Opinion extraction mines opinions at word, sentence and document levels from articles. Opinion summarization summarizes opinions of articles by telling sentiment polarities, degree and the correlated events. In this paper, both news and web blog articles are investigated. TREC, NTCIR and articles collected from web blogs serve as the information sources for opinion extraction. Documents related to the issue of animal cloning are selected as the experimental materials. Algorithms for opinion extraction at word, sentence and document level are proposed. The issue of relevant sentence selection is discussed, and then topical and opinionated information are summarized. Opinion summarizations are visualized by representative sentences. Text-based summaries in different languages, and from different sources, are compared. Finally, an opinionated curve showing supportive and nonsupportive degree along the timeline is illustrated by an opinion tracking system.},

Till to now, there are mainly four different problems predominating in this research community, namely, subjectivity classification, word sentiment classification, document sentiment classification and opinion extraction. In fact, there are inherent relations between them. Subjectivity classification can prevent the sentiment classifier from considering irrelevant or even potentially misleading text. Document sentiment classification and opinion extraction have often involved word sentiment classification techniques. This survey discusses related issues and main approaches to these problems.},

This task represents an interesting twist on standard multi-class text categorization because there are several different degrees of similarity between class labels; for example, three stars is intuitively closer to four stars than to one star. We rst evaluate human performance at the task. Then, we apply a metaalgorithm, based on a metric labeling formulation of the problem, that alters a given -ary classier's output in an explicit attempt to ensure that similar items receive similar labels. We show that the meta-algorithm can provide signi- cant improvements over both multi-class and regression versions of SVMs when we employ a novel similarity measure appropriate to the problem.},

abstract = {An important part of our information-gathering behavior has always been to find out what other people think. With the growing availability and popularity of opinion-rich resources such as online review sites and personal blogs, new opportunities and challenges arise as people now can, and do, actively use information technologies to seek out and understand the opinions of others. The sudden eruption of activity in the area of opinion mining and sentiment analysis, which deals with the computational treatment of opinion, sentiment, and subjectivity in text, has thus occurred at least in part as a direct response to the surge of interest in new systems that deal directly with opinions as a first-class object. This survey covers techniques and approaches that promise to directly enable opinion-oriented information-seeking systems. Our focus is on methods that seek to address the new challenges raised by sentiment-aware applications, as compared to those that are already present in more traditional fact-based analysis. We include material on summarization of evaluative text and on broader issues regarding privacy, manipulation, and economic impact that the development of opinion-oriented information-access services gives rise to.

To do this we develop a corpus of financial blogs, annotated with polarity of sentiment with respect to a number of companies. We conduct an analysis of the annotated corpus, from which we show there is a significant level of topic shift within this collection, and also illustrate the difficulty that human annotators have when annotating certain sentiment categories. To deal with the problem of topic shift within blog articles, we propose text extraction techniques to create topic-specific sub-documents, which we use to train a sentiment classifier. We show that such approaches provide a substantial improvement over full documentclassification and that word-based approaches perform better than sentence-based or paragraph-based approaches.},

abstract = {One of the most important issues in machine learning is whether one can improve the performance of a supervised learning algorithm by including unlabeled data. Methods that use both labeled and unlabeled data are generally referred to as semi-supervised learning. Although a number of such methods are proposed, at the current stage, we still don't have a complete understanding of their effectiveness. This paper investigates a closely related problem, which leads to a novel approach to semi-supervised learning. Specifically we consider learning predictive structures on hypothesis spaces (that is, what kind of classifiers have good predictive power) from multiple learning tasks. We present a general framework in which the structural learning problem can be formulated and analyzed theoretically, and relate it to learning with unlabeled data. Under this framework, algorithms for structural learning will be proposed, and computational issues will be investigated. Experiments will be given to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithms in the semi-supervised learning setting.},

abstract = {This paper presents a simple unsupervised learning algorithm for classifying reviews as recommended (thumbs up) or not recommended (thumbs down). The classification of a review is predicted by the average semantic orientation of the phrases in the review that contain adjectives or adverbs. A phrase has a positive semantic orientation when it has good associations (e.g., “subtle nuances”) and a negative semantic orientation when it has bad associations (e.g., “very cavalier”). In this paper, the semantic orientation of a phrase is calculated as the mutual information between the given phrase and the word “excellent” minus the mutual information between the given phrase and the word “poor”. A review is classified as recommended if the average semantic orientation of its phrases is positive. The algorithm achieves an average accuracy of 74\% when evaluated on 410 reviews from Epinions, sampled from four different domains (reviews of automobiles, banks, movies, and travel destinations). The accuracy ranges from 84\% for automobile reviews to 66\% for movie reviews.},

@misc{Wu2008a,
abstract = {Current interest in automatic sentiment analysis is motivated by a variety of information requirements. The vast majority of work in sentiment analysis has been specifically targeted at detecting subjective statements and mining opinions. This dissertation focuses on a different but related problem that to date has received relatively little attention in NLP research: detecting implicit sentiment, or spin, in text. This text classification task is distinguished from other sentiment analysis work in that there is no assumption that the documents to be classified with respect to sentiment are necessarily overt expressions of opinion. They rather are documents that might reveal a perspective. This dissertation describes a novel approach to the identification of implicit sentiment, motivated by ideas drawn from the literature on lexical semantics and argument structure, supported and refined through psycholinguistic experimentation. A relationship predictive of sentiment is established for components of meaning that are thought to be drivers of verbal argument selection and linking and to be arbiters of what is foregrounded or backgrounded in discourse. In computational experiments employing targeted lexical selection for verbs and nouns, a set of features reflective of these components of meaning is extracted for the terms. As observable proxies for the underlying semantic components, these features are exploited using machine learning methods for text classification with respect to perspective. After initial experimentation with manually selected lexical resources, the method is generalized to require no manual selection or hand tuning of any kind. The robustness of this linguistically motivated method is demonstrated by successfully applying it to three distinct text domains under a number of different experimental conditions, obtaining the best classification accuracies yet reported for several sentiment classification tasks. A novel graph-based classifier combination method is introduced which further improves classification accuracy by integrating statistical classifiers with models of inter-document relationships.},

By analyzing this corpus, we derive lists of happy and sad words and phrases annotated by their ‘happiness factor.’ Various semantic analyses performed with this wordlist reveal the happiness trajectory of a 24-day (3am and 9-10p are most happy), and a 7-day week (Wednesdays are saddest), and compare the socialness and humancenteredness of happy descriptions versus sad descriptions. We evaluate our corpus-based approach in a classification task and contrast our wordlist with emotionally-annotated wordlists produced by experimental focus groups.

abstract = {This dissertation deals with the task of extracting customer opinions from web documents. This task is the key component of opinion mining, which allows Web users to retrieve and summarize people's opinions scattered over Web documents. Our aim is to develop a method for extracting opinions, that represent eval- uation of consumer products, in a structured form. In this dissertation, we ap- proaches opinion extraction by addressing the following two unexplored issues: how to de ne the task of opinion extraction and how to extract the structured opinions. Based on a corpus study, we de ne an opinion unit consisting of a quadruple, that is, the opinion holder, the subject being evaluated (Subject), the part or the attribute in which it is evaluated (Aspect), and the evaluation that expresses a positive or negative assessment (Evaluation). We use this de nition as a basis for our opinion extraction task. For the second issue, we divide this task into two subtasks: (a) extracting relations between subjects/aspects and evaluations, and (b) extracting relations between subjects/aspects and aspects. Firstly, we consider the approach to ex- tract these relations using a list of expressions which possibly describe subjects, aspects or evaluations. We propose a semi-automatic method for collecting as- pect/evaluation expressions, which uses particular co-occurrence patterns of sub- jects, aspects and evaluations. Our semi-automatic method can collect these expressions much more eficiently than manual collection. Secondly, we discuss a method for extracting aspect-evaluation relations using dictionaries of aspect and evaluation. We point out that nding the aspect of an evaluation is similar to nd- ing the missing antecedent of an ellipsis, and introduce a machine learning-based method used for anaphora resolution to this task. By using anaphora resolution techniques, we achieve nearly 20 point improvement in F-measure compared with a baseline model. Thirdly, we approach the task for extracting aspect-evaluation relations and aspect-aspect relations without relying on an aspect dictionary. We approach two subtasks using methods which combine contextual clues and context-independent statistical clues. We show that the models using the con- textual clues show nearly 10 \% improvement in both recall and precision, and the contextual clues learned in a domain are e ective in other domains, which indicates the portability of our proposed model.},

In this paper, we propose a novel propagation approach that exploits the rela- tions between sentiment words and topics or prod- uct features that the sentiment words modify, and also sentiment words and product features them- selves to extract new sentiment words. As the me- thod propagates information through both sentiment words and features, we call it double propagation. The extraction rules are designed based on relations described in dependency trees. A new method is also proposed to assign polarities to newly discov- ered sentiment words in a domain. Experimental results show that our approach is able to extract a large number of new sentiment words. The polarity assignment method is also effective.},

abstract = {Web advertising (Online advertising), a form of advertising that uses the World Wide Web to attract customers, has become one of the world’s most important marketing channels. This paper addresses the mechanism of Content-based advertising (Contextual advertising), which refers to the assignment of relevant ads to a generic web page, e.g., a blog post. As blogs become a platform for expressing personal opinion, they naturally contain various kinds of expressions, including both facts and comments of both a positive and negative nature. Besides, in line with the major tenet of Web 2.0 (i.e., user-centric), we believe that the web-site owners would be willing to be in charge of the ads which are positively related to their contents. Hence, in this paper, we propose the utilization of sentiment detection to improve Web-based contextual advertising. The proposed sentiment-oriented contextual advertising (SOCA) framework aims to combine contextual advertising matching with sentiment analysis to select ads that are related to the positive (and neutral) aspects of a blog and rank them according to their relevance. We experimentally validate our approach using a set of data that includes both real ads and actual blog pages. The results indicate that our proposed method can effectively identify those ads that are positively correlated with the given blog pages.},

As all appear to succeed and fail in different aspects, it is far from evident which paradigm is the optimal one for the task. In this paper, we describe a quasi-compositional sentiment learning and parsing framework that is well-suited for exhaustive, uniform, and principled sentiment classification across words, phrases, and sentences. Using a hybrid approach, we model one fundamental logically defensible compositional sentiment process directly and use supervised learning to account for more complex forms of compositionality learnt from mere flat phrase- and sentencelevel sentiment annotations. The proposed framework operates on quasi-compositional sentiment polarity sequences which succinctly capture the sentiment in syntactic constituents across different structural levels without any conventional n-gram features. The results obtained with the initial implementation are highly encouraging and highlight a few surprising observations pertaining to role of syntactic information and sense-level sentiment ambiguity.},

This paper presents a novel framework for target-based opinion analysis, which extracts opinionated sentences and identifies their opinion targets from news articles. To determine whether a sentence includes opinions, we utilize opinion lexicons (i.e., predefined clue words) and linguistic patterns. In identifying the opinion target, candidates are generated and examined for existence of four different features. We attempt to capture the relationship between an object target and opinion clues and utilize a document theme. For evaluation, we used English news articles from New York Times, provided by NTCIR-8 MOAT and annotated opinionated sentences and theirs opinion targets. Experimental results show that our proposed method is promising although many additional issues remain to be studied in the future.},

Opinion mining system makes false hits while attempting to compute polarity values for non-subjective or factual sentences or documents. It becomes imperative to decide whether a given document contains subjective information or not as well as to identify which portions of the document are subjective or factual. In this work a theme detection technique has been evolved for more generic domain independent subjectivity detection that classifies sentences with binary feature: opinionated or non-opinionated. Theme detection technique examines sentence level opinion and finally accumulates the opinion clues to reach the discourse level subjectivity. The subjectivity detection system has been evaluated on the multi perspective question answering (MPQA) corpus as well as on Bengali corpus. The system evaluation has shown the precision and recall values of 76.08 and 83.33 for English and 72.16 and 76.00 for Bengali respectively.},

For anyone interested in understanding net user expectations, such web sites are of major importance because they offer the opportunity to probe huge volume of user generated contents. But to actually benefit from those large amount of data, one has to be able to automatically extract users opinions. This is the challenge we tackle in this paper. Our goal is to exploit the various reviews written by a user in order to compute a model which can then be used to predict the user’s verdict on a movie. We explore two different methods to extract opinions. The first one relies on a machine learning technique based on a naive bayesian classifier. The second method consists in applying NLP techniques to process opinions and build dictionaries : those dictionaries are then used to determine the polarity of a comment given the words it may contain. We did apply those two approaches to contents from flixster.com : the results we provide enable us to discern the most appropriate approach for a given set of data.},

This article reports a study of a month of English Twitter posts, assessing whether popular events are typically associated with increases in sentiment strength, as seems intuitively likely. Using the top 30 events, determined by a measure of relative increase in (general) term usage, the results give strong evidence that popular events are normally associated with increases in negative sentiment strength and some evidence that peaks of interest in events have stronger positive sentiment than the time before the peak. It seems that many positive events, such as the Oscars, are capable of generating increased negative sentiment in reaction to them. Nevertheless, the surprisingly small average change in sentiment associated with popular events (typically 1\% and only 6\% for Tiger Woods confessions) is consistent with events affording posters opportunities to satisfy pre-existing personal goals more often than eliciting instinctive reactions.},

abstract = {This paper makes a systematic study on disambiguating sentiment ambiguous adjectives within context in real text, which is an interaction between word sense disambiguation and sentiment analysis. We firstly address the issue of inter-annotator agreement on assigning semantic orientations to word occurrences in real text. Secondly we demonstrate that co-occurring sentiment monosemous adjectives can not effectively disambiguate sentiment ambiguous adjectives. Then collocation-based disambiguation and support vector machine (SVM) algorithm are exploited on the task of disambiguation. We present a new approach of combining collocation information and SVM to disambiguate sentiment ambiguous words. The experimental results show that the combining approach of Coll+SVM outperforms both collocation-based method and SVM algorithm.},

However, when applying sentiment analysis to the news domain, it is necessary to clearly define the scope of the task, in a more specific manner than it has been done in the field so far. The main tasks we identified for news opinion mining are: definition of the target; separation of the good and bad news content from the good and bad sentiment expressed on the target; and analysis of clearly marked opinion that is expressed explicitly, not needing interpretation or the use of world knowledge. It is furthermore important to distinguish three different possible views on newspaper articles – author, reader and text. These have to be addressed differently at the time of analysing sentiment, especially the case of author intention and reader interpretation, where specific profiles must be defined if the proper sentiment is to be extracted.},

abstract = {The explosion of user-generated content on the Web has led to new opportunities and significant challenges for companies, that are increasingly concerned about monitoring the discussion around their products. Tracking such discussion on weblogs, provides useful insight on how to improve products or market them more effectively. An important component of such analysis is to characterize the sentiment expressed in blogs about specific brands and products. Sentiment Analysis focuses on this task of automatically identifying whether a piece of text expresses a positive or negative opinion about the subject matter. Most previous work in this area uses prior lexical knowledge in terms of the sentiment-polarity of words. In contrast, some recent approaches treat the task as a text classification problem, where they learn to classify sentiment based only on labeled training data. In this paper, we present a unified framework in which one can use background lexical information in terms of word-class associations, and refine this information for specific domains using any available training examples. Empirical results on diverse domains show that our approach performs better than using background knowledge or training data in isolation, as well as alternative approaches to using lexical knowledge with text classification.},

We first propose various techniques using collocation and pivot words to extract a weighted graph of terms from user reviews and to account for positive and negative opinions. We refer to this graph as the sentiment graph. Using PageRank and a very small set of adjectives (such as good, excellent, etc.) we rank the different items. We illustrate and evaluate our approach using reviews of box office movies by users of a popular movie review site. The results show that our approach is very effective and that the ranking it computes is comparable to the ranking obtained from the box office figures.

In this first computational study of amelioration and pejoration we adapt a web-based method for determining semantic orientation to the task of identifying ameliorations and pejorations in corpora from differing time periods. We evaluate our proposed method on a small dataset of known historical ameliorations and pejorations, and find it to perform better than a random baseline. Since this test dataset is small, we conduct a further evaluation on artificial examples of amelioration and pejoration, and again find evidence that our proposed method is able to identify changes in semantic orientation. Finally, we conduct a preliminary evaluation in which we apply our methods to the task of finding words which have recently undergone amelioration or pejoration.},

It has also been observed that previous attempts for textual affect sensing have categorized texts into a number of emotion groups, e.g. six so-called basic emotion proposed by Paul Ekman which we believe insufficient to classify textual emotions. Hence we propose a different approach to sense affective information from texts by applying the cognitive theory of emotions known as OCC model 1 which distinguishes several emotion types that can be identified by assessing the valanced reactions to events, agents or objects described in the texts. In particular we want to create a formal model that can not only understand what emotions people wrap with their textual messages, but also can make automatic empathic response with respect to the emotional state detected in the text (e.g. in a chat system). We first briefly describe relevant works and then we explain our proposal with examples. Finally we conclude with future work plans.},

Positive and negative opinions embedded in documents are useful references and feedbacks for governments to improve their services, for companies to market their products, and for customers to purchase their objects. Web opinion mining aims to extract, summarize, and track various aspects of subjective information on the Web. Mining subjective information enables traditional information retrieval (IR) systems to retrieve more data from human viewpoints and provide information with finer granularity. Opinion extraction identifies opinion holders, extracts the relevant opinion sentences, and decides their polarities. Opinion summarization recognizes the major events embedded in documents and summarizes the supportive and the nonsupportive evidence. Opinion tracking captures subjective information from various genres and monitors the developments of opinions from spatial and temporal dimensions. To demonstrate and evaluate the proposed opinion mining algorithms, news and bloggers' articles are adopted. Documents in the evaluation corpora are tagged in different granularities from words, sentences to documents. In the experiments, positive and negative sentiment words and their weights are mined on the basis of Chinese word structures. The f-measure is 73.18\% and 63.75\% for verbs and nouns, respectively. Utilizing the sentiment words mined together with topical words, we achieve f-measure 62.16\% at the sentence level and 74.37\% at the document level.},

@phdthesis{Esuli2008a,
abstract = {Opinion mining is a recent discipline at the crossroads of Information Retrieval and of Computational Linguistics which is concerned not with the topic a document is about, but with the opinion it expresses. It has a rich set of applications, ranging from tracking users’ opinions about products or about political candidates as expressed in online forums, to customer relationship management. Functional to the extraction of opinions from text is the determination of the relevant entities of the language that are used to express opinions, and their opinion-related properties. For example, determining that the term beautiful casts a positive connotation to its subject. In this thesis we investigate on the automatic recognition of opinionrelated properties of terms. This results into building opinion-related lexical resources, which can be used into opinion mining applications. We start from the (relatively) simple problem of determining the orientation of subjective terms. We propose an original semi-supervised term classification model that is based on the quantitative analysis of the glosses of such terms, i.e. the definitions that these terms are given in on-line dictionaries. This method outperforms all known methods when tested on the recognized standard benchmarks for this task. We show how our method is capable to produce good results on more complex tasks, such as discriminating subjective terms (e.g., good) from objective ones (e.g., green), or classifying terms on a fine-grained attitude taxonomy. We then propose a relevant refinement of the task, i.e., distinguishing the opinion-related properties of distinct term senses. We present SentiWordNet, a novel high-quality, high-coverage lexical resource, where each one of the 115,424 senses contained in WordNet has been automatically evaluated on the three dimensions of positivity, negativity, and objectivity. We propose also an original and effective use of random-walk models to rank term senses by their positivity or negativity. The random-walk algorithms we present have a great application potential also outside the opinion mining area, for example in word sense disambiguation tasks. A result of this experience is the generation of an improved version of SentiWordNet. We finally evaluate and compare the various versions of Senti- WordNet we present here with other opinion-related lexical resources well-known in literature, experimenting their use in an Opinion Extraction application. We show that the use of SentiWordNet produces a significant improvement with respect to the baseline system, not using any specialized lexical resource, and also with respect to the use of other opinion-related lexical resources.},

We try to capture the contextual constraints on sentence sentiment using CRFs. Through introducing redundant labels into the original sentimental label set and organizing all labels into a hierarchy, our method can add redundant features into training for capturing the label redundancy. The experimental results prove that our method outperforms the traditional methods like NB, SVM, MaxEnt and standard chain CRFs. In comparison with the cascaded model, our method can effectively alleviate the error propagation among different layers and obtain better performance in each layer.},

In particular, beyond psychological models of sentiments that define affective states as multidimensional vectors in affective continuous spaces, we identify three components of graduality, namely composition or blending, intensity and inheritance. In our discussion, we review how fuzzy set theory as well as other gradual structures based on a vectorial representation are employed to describe affective states as complex or imprecise entities. Finally, we focus on verbal expressions of sentiments and more specifically, we discuss the use of components of graduality in order to deal with sentiments complex and subtle expressions issued from the expressive power of natural languages.},

Tests are done through computing the Kullback-Leibler divergence between the language model estimated from test document and these two trained sentiment models. We assert the polarity of a test document by observing whether its language model is close to the trained "thumb up" model or the "thumb down" model.

abstract = {In this paper, we analyze how different dimensions of a sellers reputation affect pricing power in electronic markets. Given the interplay between buyers trust and sellers pricing power, we use text mining techniques to identify and structure dimensions of importance from feedback posted on reputation systems. By aggregating and scoring these dimensions based on the sentiment they contain, we use them to estimate a series of econometric models associating reputation with price premiums. We find that different dimensions do indeed affect pricing power differentially, and that a negative reputation hurts more than a positive one helps on some dimensions but not on others. We provide evidence that sellers of identical products in electronic markets differentiate themselves based on a distinguishing dimension of strength, and that buyers vary in the relative importance they place on different fulfilment characteristics. We highlight the importance of textual reputation feedback further by demonstrating that it substantially improves the performance of a classifier we have trained to predict future sales. Our results also suggest that online sellers distinguish themselves on specific and varying fulfilment characteristics that resemble the unique selling points highlighted by successful brands. We conclude by providing explicit examples of IT artifacts (buyer and seller tools) that use our interdisciplinary approach to enhance buyer trust and seller efficiency in online environments. This paper is the first study that integrates econometric, text mining and predictive modeling techniques toward a more complete analysis of the information captured by reputation systems, and it presents new evidence of the importance of their effective and judicious design in online markets.},

We study the problem of analyzing users’ sentiment and opinion in their blog, message board, etc. posts with respect to topics expressed as a search query. In the scenario we consider the matches of the search query terms are expanded through coreference and meronymy to produce a set of mentions. The mentions are contextually evaluated for sentiment and their scores are aggregated (using a data structure we introduce call the sentiment propagation graph) to produce an aggregate score for the input entity. An extremely crucial part in the contextual evaluation of individual mentions is finding which sentiment expressions are semantically related to (target) which mentions — this is the focus of our paper. We present an approach where potential target mentions for a sentiment expression are ranked using supervised machine learning (Support Vector Machines) where the main features are the syntactic configurations (typed dependency paths) connecting the sentiment expression and the mention. We have created a large English corpus of product discussions blogs annotated with semantic types of mentions, coreference, meronymy and sentiment targets. The corpus proves that coreference and meronymy are not marginal phenomena but are really central to determining the overall sentiment for the toplevel entity. We evaluate a number of techniques for sentiment targeting and present results which we believe push the current state-of-the-art.},

The paper aims at addressing sentiment analysis for product features in product reviews written in Chinese by building the semantic associations between product features and sentiment words. The patterns, which identify semantic associations between sentiment words and features, and the approach, which builds the sentiment list of each feature, are proposed. The sentiment list of each feature is built up in the course of building semantic associations related to the feature. Using sentiment lists, the average sentiment expressed on each feature can be obtained. Our method is unsupervised. The result shows that our method is encouraging.},

Beginning with a review of relevant literature in linguistics and psychology, I trace recent interest in automated detection of author opinion in online product reviews, focusing on two main approaches: the semantic model, which is centered on deriving the semantic orientation (SO) of individual words and expressions, and machine learning classifiers, which rely on statistical information gathered from large corpora. To show the potential long-term advantages of the former, I describe the creation of an SO Calculator, highlighting relevant linguistic features such as intensification, negation, modality, and discourse structure, and devoting particular attention to the detection of genre in movie reviews, integrating machine classifier modules into my core semantic model. Finally, I discuss sentiment analysis in languages other than English, including Spanish and Chinese.},

However, selecting combination of features on learning with large-scale and feature-rich training data requires long training time. We propose a fast boosting-based algorithm for learning rules represented by combination of features. Our algorithm constructs a set of rules by repeating the process to select several rules from a small proportion of candidate rules. The candidate rules are generated from a subset of all the features with a technique similar to beam search. Then we propose POS tagging and text chunking based on our learning algorithm. Our tagger and chunker use candidate POS tags or chunk tags of each word collected from automatically tagged data. We evaluate our methods with English POS tagging and text chunking. The experimental results show that the training time of our algorithm are about 50 times faster than Support Vector Machines with polynomial kernel on the average while maintaining state-of-the-art accuracy and faster classification speed.},

Findings Purely text-based methods performed poorly, but could be improved using techniques which took into account the users position in the online community. Research limitations/implications The techniques we applied here are fairly simple, and more sophisticated learning algorithms may yield better results for text-based classification.

In particular, since the emergence of the Web 2.0, opinions about companies and their services or products need to be found and distilled in order to create an accurate picture of a business entity.

This paper describes a series of experiments to assess the value of a number of lexical, morpho-syntactic, and sentiment-based features derived from linguistic processing and from an existing lexical database for the classi cation of evalu- ative texts. The paper describes experiments carried out with two different web sources: one source contains positive and negative opinions while the other con- tains ne grain classi cations in a 5-point qualitative scale. The results obtain are positive and in line with current research in the area. Our aim is to use the result of classi cation in a practical application that will combine factual and opinionated information in order to create the reputation of a business entity.},

abstract = {Competitive Intelligence is one of the key factors for enterprise risk management and decision support. However, the functions of Competitive Intelligence are often greatly restricted by the lack of sufficient information sources about the competitors. With the emergence of Web 2.0, the large numbers of customer-generated product reviews often contain information about competitors and have become a new source of mining Competitive Intelligence. In this study, we proposed a novel graphical model to extract and visualize comparative relations between products from customer reviews, with the interdependencies among relations taken into consideration, to help enterprises discover potential risks and further design new products and marketing strategies. Our experiments on a corpus of Amazon customer reviews show that our proposed method can extract comparative relations more accurately than the benchmark methods. Furthermore, this study opens a door to analyzing the rich consumer-generated data for enterprise risk management.},

abstract = {Sentiments about a given subject, be it a commercial product or any other topic of interest can contain a wealth of information not only of the generic opinion toward the subject but also individual opinions of its several features or sub-topics. Automated, context unaware extraction of sentiment polarities toward the individual features that make up the subject has seen extensive research and generally involves two phases. The first phase involves the extraction of feature phrases from the document. This involves the separation of the topic-specific part from the rest of the document. The method chosen for implementation, due to its absolute non-requisite of contextual knowledge, is probabilistic mixture-model based and constructs multinomial distributions of occurrence frequencies for candidate feature phrases, in both the document (topic specific language model), and the whole corpus (generic language model). Then, a maximum likelihood estimation routine is run on the candidate phrases and their respective occurrence frequencies in the corpus and document to filter out the feature phrases from the others. Thus, features are extracted without any knowledge of topic or any other form of context. In the second phase, individual words of a feature phrase are provided to a pre-defined word-sentiment database and the net sentiment polarity is decided from the sum of the results, which provides for a decently accurate estimate owing to the additive nature of the English language (polarity changing words like ‗not‘ are not mined in the features. Due to this, we can assume that the features, along with the sentiment polarities are closely related (semantically speaking) to the document even if they don‘t fall within the crux of what is being conveyed. ). This project will attempt to implement and test this algorithm on different sets of test data and compare the performance results to try and infer the effectiveness of context unaware methods of text mining, in general, for different domains of text data. Keywords: feature phrase, context awareness, sentiment polarity, corpus, language model, occurrence frequency, maximum likelihood estimation, word-sentiment database.},

abstract = {Determining the polarity of a sentimentbearing expression requires more than a simple bag-of-words approach. In particular, words or constituents within the expression can interact with each other to yield a particular overall polarity. In this paper, we view such subsentential interactions in light of compositional semantics, and present a novel learningbased approach that incorporates structural inference motivated by compositional semantics into the learning procedure. Our experiments show that (1) simple heuristics based on compositional semantics can perform better than learning-based methods that do not incorporate compositional semantics (accuracy of 89.7 \% vs. 89.1\%), but (2) a method that integrates compositional semantics into learning performs better than all other alternatives (90.7\%). We also find that “contentword negators”, not widely employed in previous work, play an important role in determining expression-level polarity. Finally, in contrast to conventional wisdom, we find that expression-level classification accuracy uniformly decreases as additional, potentially disambiguating, context is considered.},

As a result of the analysis, text can be categorized into emotional states and communicative functions. A designed graphical representation of a user (avatar) displays emotions and social behaviour driven by text and performs natural idle movements.

We not only investigate how different levels of information can be effectively combined in different kernels but also examine how the scope of these kernels should be chosen. In general relation extraction, the two candidate entities thought to be involved in a relation are commonly chosen to be the boundaries of sequences and trees. The definition of boundaries in opinion holder extraction, however, is less straightforward since there might be several expressions beside the candidate opinion holder to be eligible for being a boundary.},

abstract = {Automatic sentiment analysis in texts has attracted considerable attention in recent years. Most of the approaches developed to classify texts or sentences as positive or negative rest on a very specific kind of language resource: emotional lexicons. To build these resources, several automatic techniques have been proposed. Some of them are based on dictionaries while others use corpora. One of the main advantages of the corpora techniques is that they can build lexicons that are tailored for a specific application simply by using a specific corpus. Currently, only anecdotal observations and data from other areas of language processing plead in favour of the utility of specific corpora. This research aims to test this hypothesis. An experiment based on 702 sentences evaluated by judges shows that automatic techniques developed for estimating the valence from relatively small corpora are more efficient if the corpora used contain texts similar to the one that must be evaluated.},

abstract = {Coreference resolution is a classic NLP problem and has been studied extensively by many researchers. Most existing studies, however, are generic in the sense that they are not focused on any specific text. In the past few years, opinion mining became a popular topic of research because of a wide range of applications. However, limited work has been done on coreference resolution in opinionated text. In this paper, we deal with object and attribute coreference resolution. Such coreference resolutions are important because without solving it a great deal of opinion information will be lost, and opinions may be assigned to wrong entities. We show that some important features related to opinions can be exploited to perform the task more accurately. Experimental results using blog posts demonstrate the effectiveness of the technique.},

abstract = {The growing stream of content placed on the Web provides a huge collection of textual resources. People share their experiences on-line, ventilate their opinions (and frustrations), or simply talk just about anything. The large amount of available data creates opportunities for automatic mining and analysis. The information we are interested in this paper, is how people feel about certain topics. We consider it as a classification task: their feelings can be positive, negative or neutral. A sentiment isnt always stated in a clear way in the text; it is often represented in subtle, complex ways. Besides direct expression of the user's feelings towards a certain topic, he or she can use a diverse range of other techniques to express his or her emotions. On top of that, authors may mix objective and subjective information about a topic, or write down thoughts about other topics than the one we are investigating. Lastly, the data gathered from the World Wide Web often contains a lot of noise. All of this makes the task of automatic recognition of the sentiment in on-line text more difficult. We will give an overview of various techniques used to tackle the problems in the domain of sentiment analysis, and add some of our own results.},

Key findings * At its peak, the conversation about Michael Jackson’s death on Twitter proceeded at a rate of 78 tweets per second. * Users tweeting about Jackson’s death tend to use far more words associated with negative emotions than are found in ‘everyday’ tweets. * Roughly 3/4 of tweets about Jackson’s death that use the word “sad” actually express sadness, suggesting that sentiment analysis based on word usage is fairly accurate. * That said, there is extensive disagreement between human coders about the emotional content of tweets, even for emotions that we might expect would be clear (like sadness). * Tweets expressing personal, emotional sadness about the Jackson’s death showed strong agreement among coders while commentary on the auxiliary social effects of Jackson’s death showed strong disagreement. * We argue that this pattern in the “understandability” of certain types of communication across Twitter is due to the way the platform structures the expression of its users.},

abstract = {Merchants selling products on the Web often ask their customers to review the products that they have purchased and the associated services. As e-commerce is becoming more and more popular, the number of customer reviews that a product receives grows rapidly. For a popular product, the number of reviews can be in hundreds or even thousands. This makes it difficult for a potential customer to read them to make an informed decision on whether to purchase the product. It also makes it difficult for the manufacturer of the product to keep track and to manage customer opinions. For the manufacturer, there are additional difficulties because many merchant sites may sell the same product and the manufacturer normally produces many kinds of products. In this research, we aim to mine and to summarize all the customer reviews of a product. This summarization task is different from traditional text summarization because we only mine the features of the product on which the customers have expressed their opinions and whether the opinions are positive or negative. We do not summarize the reviews by selecting a subset or rewrite some of the original sentences from the reviews to capture the main points as in the classic text summarization. Our task is performed in three steps: (1) mining product features that have been commented on by customers; (2) identifying opinion sentences in each review and deciding whether each opinion sentence is positive or negative; (3) summarizing the results. This paper proposes several novel techniques to perform these tasks. Our experimental results using reviews of a number of products sold online demonstrate the effectiveness of the techniques.},

Our approach is multi-step, where in the initial step a standard topic classifier is learned from the data and the topic labels, and in the ensuing step several polarity classifiers, one per topic, are learned from the data and the polarity labels. We empirically show that our approach improves classification accuracy over a real-world dataset by over 10\%, when compared against a standard single-step approach using the same feature sets. The approach is applicable whenever training material is available for building both topic and polarity learning models. 2009 Springer Berlin Heidelberg.},

abstract = {Automatic sentiment analysis is an important and challenging topic in Human Language Technology (HLT) and text mining, with several applications for social sciences. Over recent years, much effort has been devoted to this subject. Many published works on this subject employ various machine learning techniques. In our work, we investigate the feasibility of automatically identifying text sentiment orientation by combining knowledge resources and NLP techniques, as a complementary method to those based on machine learning. Our approach involves resources and tools including a subjectivity lexicon (Wilson et al., 2005), a set of NLP tools and weighting algorithms. We developed a sentiment analysis tool with a web demonstrator This tool has been used jointly with other text mining tools to support social scientists in frame analysis from newspaper articles. In this paper, we describe our system and report on our evaluation of the functionality of identifying sentiment orientation at the sentence and document levels. We used the Multi-Perspective Question Answering (MPQA) Corpus (Wiebe et al., 2005) and a collection of 2,000 manually classified film reviews (Pang and Lee, 2004) as the test data. As evaluation measure, we used f-score, a performance measure that combines precision and recall and ranges between 0 (worst performance) and 1 (best performance). In the evaluation, our sentiment analysis tool obtained encouraging results, producing f-scores ranging from 0.6012 to 0.8333 for sentence-level sentiment analysis and an average f-score of 0.7196 for document-level sentiment analysis.},

abstract = {This paper presents Q-WordNet, a lexical resource consisting of WordNet senses automatically annotated by positive and negative polarity. Polarity classification amounts to decide whether a text (sense, sentence, etc.) may be associated to positive or negative connotations. Polarity classification is becoming important for applications such as Opinion Mining and Sentiment Analysis, which facilitates the extraction and analysis of opinions about commercial products, on companies reputation management, brand monitoring, or to track attitudes by mining online forums, blogs, etc. Inspired by work on classification of word senses by polarity (e.g., SentiWordNet), and takingWordNet as a starting point, we build Q-WordNet. Instead of applying external tools such as supervised classifiers to annotated WordNet synsets by polarity, we try to effectively maximize the linguistic information contained in WordNet, thereby taking advantage of the human effort put by lexicographers and annotators. The resulting resource is a subset of WordNet senses classified as positive or negative. In this approach, neutral polarity is seen as the absence of positive or negative polarity. The evaluation of Q-WordNet shows an improvement with respect to previous approaches. We believe that Q-WordNet can be used as a starting point for data-driven approaches in sentiment analysis.},

Veredito (3,5 ou 4 / 5):
        
- Tem pontos de vista interessantes, com os quais concordo (ver abaixo);
- Adopta uma vis\~{a}o mais pr\'{a}tica, o que interessa saber \'{e} o qu\^{e} que o Q-WordNet e o SentiWordNet devolvem como sa\'{\i}da e entender o significado desses valores (ver baixo).
- Dif\'{\i}cil atribuir nota, por n\~{a}o ter lido trabalhos sobre o Q-WordNet.

        
          
Ideias interessantes:
        
- Chama \`{a} aten\c{c}\~{a}o (2º par\'{a}grafo, sec\c{c}\~{a}o 2), para o facto de muitos trabalhos assumirem que para atribuir uma polaridade (conota\c{c}\~{a}o positiva ou negativa) \`{a} palavra, \'{e} necess\'{a}rio determinar se a palavra \'{e} objectiva ou subjectiva, para depois atribuir a polaridade apenas a palavras subjectivas,  deixando de fora palavras objectivas que podem ser classificadas objectivamente como positivas ou negativas, como por exemplo "cancer", "tuberculosis" (apesar de estas palavras podem n\~{a}o ser negativas no dominio m\'{e}dico, mas  s\~{a}o-no no "dom\'{\i}nio geral").
Pesquisei no SentiWordNet e confirma-se o que foi dito.
Os autores e EU n\~{a}o concordamos com esta assun\c{c}\~{a}o.

        
          
Diferen\c{c}as entre SentiWordNet e Q-WordNet:
        
1. Os valores de classifica\c{c}\~{a}o atribuida a cada palavra;
O SentiWord atribui um valor \`{a}s classes positivo, negativo e objectivo, sendo que a soma  tem que dar 1 (isto implica que se a palavra tem objectividade de 1, n\~{a}o \'{e} considerada a polaridade positiva nem negativa...).
(Quando as palavras tem valores muito proximos EX: 0.40, 0.25, 0.35, segundo os autores do Q-Wordnet, podem ser d\'{\i}ficeis de usar. EU diria que \'{e} uma indica\c{c}\~{a}o que a palavra precisa de ser desambiguada, por exemplo atrav\'{e}s do contexto da frase).

        
O Q-WordNet de classifica\c{c}\~{a}o atribuida a cada palavra s\~{a}o: 0 para palavra negativa, 1 para palavra negativa, sendo que uma palavra sem nenhum valor, significa palavra neutra.

        
2. A filosofia de constru\c{c}\~{a}o; 
O SentiwordNet usa classificadores autom\'{a}ticos (?abordagem supervisionada?), enquant o Q-WordNet usa as rela\c{c}\~{o}es contidas no pr\'{o}prio WordNet (egundo os autores -> abordagem n\~{a}o supervisionada).
(A sec\c{c}\~{a}o 3. mostra a filosofia para a contru\c{c}\~{a}o do Q-WordNet)
(A tabela 3 mostra as rela\c{c}oes  usadas para navegar no wordnet) .

In some of these systems there is an option of assign- ing a sentiment value to a single sentence or a very short text. In this paper we propose a supervised sentiment classification framework which is based on data from Twitter, a popu- lar microblogging service. By utilizing 50 Twitter tags and 15 smileys as sen- timent labels, this framework avoids the need for labor intensive manual annota- tion, allowing identification and classifi- cation of diverse sentiment types of short texts. We evaluate the contribution of dif- ferent feature types for sentiment classifi- cation and show that our framework suc- cessfully identifies sentiment types of un- tagged sentences. The quality of the senti- ment identification was also confirmed by human judges. We also explore dependen- cies and overlap between different sen- timent types represented by smileys and Twitter hashtags.},

The evaluation shows that users have a strong preference for summarizers that model sentiment over non-sentiment baselines, but have no broad overall preference between any of the sentiment-based models. However, an analysis of the human judgments suggests that there are identifiable situations where one summarizer is generally preferred over the others. We exploit this fact to build a new summarizer by training a ranking SVM model over the set of human preference judgments that were collected during the evaluation, which results in a 30\% relative reduction in error over the previous best summarizer.},

@article{Zhang2008,
abstract = {Opinion retrieval is a task of growing interest in social life and academic research, which is to find relevant and opinionate documents according to a user's query. One of the key issues is how to combine a document's opinionate score (the ranking score of to what extent it is subjective or objective) and topic relevance score. Current solutions to document ranking in opinion retrieval are generally ad-hoc linear combination, which is short of theoretical foundation and careful analysis. In this paper, we focus on lexicon-based opinion retrieval. A novel generation model that unifies topic-relevance and opinion generation by a quadratic combination is proposed in this paper. With this model, the relevance-based ranking serves as the weighting factor of the lexicon-based sentiment ranking function, which is essentially different from the popular heuristic linear combination approaches. The effect of different sentiment dictionaries is also discussed. Experimental results on TREC blog datasets show the significant effectiveness of the proposed unified model. Improvements of 28.1\% and 40.3\% have been obtained in terms of MAP and p10 respectively. The conclusion is not limited to blog environment. Besides the unified generation model, another contribution is that our work demonstrates that in the opinion retrieval task, a Bayesian approach to combining multiple ranking functions is superior to using a linear combination. It is also applicable to other result re-ranking applications in similar scenario.},

@article{Hurtado2009,
abstract = {Background: Several event related potential (ERP) studies have investigated the time course of different aspects of evaluative processing in social bias research. Various reports suggest that the late positive potential (LPP) is modulated by basic evaluative processes, and some reports suggest that in-/outgroup relative position affects ERP responses. In order to study possible LPP blending between facial race processing and semantic valence (positive or negative words), we recorded ERPs while indigenous and non-indigenous participants who were matched by age and gender performed an implicit association test (IAT). The task involved categorizing faces (ingroup and outgroup) and words (positive and negative). Since our paradigm implies an evaluative task with positive and negative valence association, a frontal distribution of LPPs similar to that found in previous reports was expected. At the same time, we predicted that LPP valence lateralization would be modulated not only by positive/negative associations but also by particular combinations of valence, face stimuli and participant relative position. Results: Results showed that, during an IAT, indigenous participants with greater behavioral ingroup bias displayed a frontal LPP that was modulated in terms of complex contextual associations involving ethnic group and valence. The LPP was lateralized to the right for negative valence stimuli and to the left for positive valence stimuli. This valence lateralization was influenced by the combination of valence and membership type relevant to compatibility with prejudice toward a minority. Behavioral data from the IAT and an explicit attitudes questionnaire were used to clarify this finding and showed that ingroup bias plays an important role. Both ingroup favoritism and indigenous/non-indigenous differences were consistently present in the data. Conclusion: Our results suggest that frontal LPP is elicited by contextual blending of evaluative judgments of in-/outgroup information and positive vs. negative valence association and confirm recent research relating in-/outgroup ERP modulation and frontal LPP. LPP modulation may cohere with implicit measures of attitudes. The convergence of measures that were observed supports the idea that racial and valence evaluations are strongly influenced by context. This result adds to a growing set of evidence concerning contextual sensitivity of different measures of prejudice.},

abstract = {Recent years have brought a significant growth in the volume of research in sentiment analysis, mostly on highly subjective text types (movie or product reviews). The main difference these texts have with news articles is that their target is clearly defined and unique across the text. Following different annotation efforts and the analysis of the issues encountered, we realised that news opinion mining is different from that of other text types. We identified three subtasks that need to be addressed: definition of the target; separation of the good and bad news content from the good and bad sentiment expressed on the target; and analysis of clearly marked opinion that is expressed explicitly, not needing interpretation or the use of world knowledge. Furthermore, we distinguish three different possible views on newspaper articles – author, reader and text, which have to be addressed differently at the time of analysing sentiment. Given these definitions, we present work on mining opinions about entities in English language news, in which (a) we test the relative suitability of various sentiment dictionaries and (b) we attempt to separate positive or negative opinion from good or bad news. In the experiments described here, we tested whether or not subject domain-defining vocabulary should be ignored. Results showed that this idea is more appropriate in the context of news opinion mining and that the approaches taking this into consideration produce a better performance.},

In this paper we present a novel approach to polarity strength assignment. The approach is knowledge based in that it usesWordNet to build an adjective graph which is used to measure se- mantic distance between words of known polarity (ref- erence or seedwords) and the targetword, which is then used to assign a polarity to the target word. We ex- tend previous work in this area by using a small training data set to learn an optimal predictor of polarity strength and to dampen polarity assigned to non-polar adjectives. We also extend the coverage of previous approaches by exploring additional lexical relations not studied previ- ously. The method has been evaluated on a validation set and shows excellent potential in reducing the assign- ment of spurious polarity and accurately predicting po- larity values for polar adjectives.},

abstract = {Behavioral economics tells us that emotions can profoundly affect individual behavior and decision-making. Does this also apply to societies at large, i.e., can societies experience mood states that affect their collective decision making? By extension is the public mood correlated or even predictive of economic indicators? Here we investigate whether measurements of collective mood states derived from large-scale Twitter feeds are correlated to the value of the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) over time. We analyze the text content of daily Twitter feeds by two mood tracking tools, namely OpinionFinder that measures positive vs. negative mood and Google-Profile of Mood States (GPOMS) that measures mood in terms of 6 dimensions (Calm, Alert, Sure, Vital, Kind, and Happy). We cross-validate the resulting mood time series by comparing their ability to detect the public's response to the presidential election and Thanksgiving day in 2008. A Granger causality analysis and a Self-Organizing Fuzzy Neural Network are then used to investigate the hypothesis that public mood states, as measured by the OpinionFinder and GPOMS mood time series, are predictive of changes in DJIA closing values. Our results indicate that the accuracy of DJIA predictions can be significantly improved by the inclusion of specific public mood dimensions but not others. We find an accuracy of 87.6\% in predicting the daily up and down changes in the closing values of the DJIA and a reduction of the Mean Average Percentage Error by more than 6\%.},

A data mining approach identifies the specific aspects of students' university experience that most influence three measures of general satisfaction. The three measures have different predictors and cannot be used interchangeably. Academic experiences are influential. In particular, faculty preparedness, which has a well-known relationship to student achievement, emerges as a principal determinant of satisfaction. Social integration and pre-enrollment opinions are also important. Campus services and facilities have limited effects, and students' demographic characteristics are not significant predictors. Decision tree analysis reveals that social integration has more effect on the satisfaction of students who are less academically engaged.},

In this paper we present our machine learning experiments with regard to sentiment analysis in blog, review and forum texts found on the World Wide Web and written in English, Dutch and French. We train from a set of example sentences or statements that are manually annotated as positive, negative or neutral with regard to a certain entity. We are interested in the feelings that people express with regard to certain consumption products. We learn and evaluate several classification models that can be configured in a cascaded pipeline. We have to deal with several problems, being the noisy character of the input texts, the attribution of the sentiment to a particular entity and the small size of the training set. We succeed to identify positive, negative and neutral feelings to the entity under consideration with ca. 83\% accuracy for English texts based on unigram features augmented with linguistic features. The accuracy results of processing the Dutch and French texts are ca. 70\% and 68\% respectively due to the larger variety of the linguistic expressions that more often diverge from standard language, thus demanding more training patterns. In addition, our experiments give us insights into the portability of the learned models across domains and languages. A substantial part of the article investigates the role of active learning techniques for reducing the number of examples to be manually annotated.},

We compared the system results with and without counting the effect of negations and future state modifier strength and we found that results better than chance are rarely achieved in the second case.

An appraisal group is represented as a set of attribute values in several task-independent semantic taxonomies, based on Appraisal Theory. Semi-automated methods were used to build a lexicon of appraising adjectives and their modifiers. We classify movie reviews using features based upon these taxonomies combined with standard ``bag-of-words'' features, and report state-of-the-art accuracy of 90.2\%.

We consider sentiment assessment and emotion sensing from text as two different problems, whereby sentiment assessment is the task that we want to solve first. Thus, this article presents an approach to sentiment assessment, i.e., the recognition of negative or positive valence of a sentence. For the purpose of sentiment recognition from text, we perform semantic dependency analysis on the semantic verb frames of each sentence, and then apply a set of rules to each dependency relation to calculate the contextual valence of the whole sentence. By employing a domain-independent, rule-based approach our system is able to automatically identify sentence-level sentiment. A linguistic tool called “SenseNet” has been developed to recognize sentiments in text, and to visualize the detected sentiments. We conducted several experiments with a variety of datasets containing data from different domains. The obtained results indicate significant performance gains over existing state-of-the-art approaches.},

SENTIWORDNET 3.0 is an improved version of SENTIWORDNET 1.0, a lexical resource publicly available for research purposes, now currently licensed to more than 300 research groups and used in a variety of research projects worldwide. Both SENTIWORDNET 1.0 and 3.0 are the result of automatically annotating all WORDNET synsets according to their degrees of positivity, negativity, and neutrality. SENTIWORDNET 1.0 and 3.0 differ (a) in the versions of WORDNET which they annotate (WORDNET 2.0 and 3.0, respectively), (b) in the algorithm used for automatically annotating WORDNET, which now includes (additionally to the previous semi-supervised learning step) a random-walk step for refining the scores. We here discuss SENTIWORDNET 3.0, especially focussing on the improvements concerning aspect (b) that it embodies with respect to version 1.0. We also report the results of evaluating SENTIWORDNET 3.0 against a fragment of WORDNET 3.0 manually annotated for positivity, negativity, and neutrality; these results indicate accuracy improvements of about 20\% with respect to SENTIWORDNET 1.0.},

Data mining and analysis of such financial information can aid stock market predictions. Traditional approaches have usually relied on predictions based on past performance of the stocks. In this paper, we introduce a novel way to do stock market prediction based on sentiments of web users. Our method involves scanning for financial message boards and extracting sentiments expressed by individual authors. The system then learns the correlation between the sentiments and the stock values. The learned model can then be used to make future predictions about stock values. In our experiments, we show that our method is able to predict the sentiment with high precision and we also show that the stock performance and its recent web sentiments are also closely correlated.},

abstract = {The web contains a wealth of product reviews, but sifting through them is a daunting task. Ideally, an opinion mining tool would process a set of search results for a given item, generating a list of product attributes (quality, features, etc.) and aggregating opinions about each of them (poor, mixed, good). We begin by identifying the unique properties of this problem and develop a method for automatically distinguishing between positive and negative reviews. Our classifier draws on information retrieval techniques for feature extraction and scoring, and the results for various metrics and heuristics vary depending on the testing situation. The best methods work as well as or better than traditional machine learning. When operating on individual sentences collected from web searches, performance is limited due to noise and ambiguity. But in the context of a complete web-based tool and aided by a simple method for grouping sentences into attributes, the results are qualitatively quite useful.},

abstract = {Customer reviews contain opinions of the customers who purchased products and expressed opinions concerning their satisfactions and criticisms. Due to vast availability of product reviews in the web, it is extremely time-consuming and at times confusing for a new customer to manually analyze the reviews prior to buying a product. Reviews generally involve the presence of product feature specific factual information along with the opinion sentences depicting the pros and cons of a bought product. The unstructured format of the text reviews from most of the web review sources necessitates the automatic identification of opinion sentences from the customer reviews, and also the identification of explicitly visible and implicitly present product features associated with the opinion sentences. In this paper, a process has been described where typed dependency relations such as open clausal complements or adjectival complements have been utilized to identify opinion sentences specific to product features. The typed dependency relations in the identified opinion sentences are then used to associate a product feature to an opinion sentence with the help of the product feature associated frequent words extracted from a previously managed customer review corpus.},

In this study the use of sentiment analysis methodologies is proposed for classification of Web forum opinions in multiple languages. The utility of stylistic and syntactic features is evaluated for sentiment classification of English and Arabic content. Specific feature extraction components are integrated to account for the linguistic characteristics of Arabic. The entropy weighted genetic algorithm (EWGA) is also developed, which is a hybridized genetic algorithm that incorporates the information-gain heuristic for feature selection. EWGA is designed to improve performance and get a better assessment of key features. The proposed features and techniques are evaluated on a benchmark movie review dataset and U.S. and Middle Eastern Web forum postings. The experimental results using EWGA with SVM indicate high performance levels, with accuracies of over 91\% on the benchmark dataset as well as the U.S. and Middle Eastern forums. Stylistic features significantly enhanced performance across all testbeds while EWGA also outperformed other feature selection methods, indicating the utility of these features and techniques for document-level classification of sentiments.},

These two systems, acting complementarily, could bridge the gap between machine learning and rule-based approaches.

Examples range from the False Maria in Fritz Lang’s 1926 film Metropolis to Knight Rider’s KITT (a talking car) to Star Wars’ C-3PO (said to have been modeled on the False Maria). And, of course, there is the HAL 9000 computer from 2001: A Space Odyssey; in one of the film’s most famous scenes, the astronaut Dave asks HAL to open a pod bay door on the spacecraft, to which HAL responds, “I’m sorry Dave, I’m afraid I can’t do that”. Natural language processing, or NLP, is the field of computer science devoted to creating such machines — that is, enabling computers to use human languages both as input and as output. The area is quite broad, encompassing problems ranging from simultaneous multi-language translation to advanced search engine development to the design of computer interfaces capable of combining speech, diagrams, and other modalities simultaneously. A natural consequence of this wide range of inquiry is the integration of ideas from computer science with work from many other fields, including linguistics, which provides models of language; psychology, which provides models of cognitive processes; information theory, which provides models of communication; and mathematics and statistics, which provide tools for analyzing and acquiring such models.},

Then, the translated document is classified according to its sentiment into one of the classes "positive" and "negative". For sentiment classification, a document is searched for sentiment bearing words like adjectives. By means of SentiWordNet, scores for positivity and negativity are determined for these words. An interpretation of the scores then leads to the document polarity. The method is tested for German movie reviews selected from Amazon and is compared to a statistical polarity classifier based on n-grams. The results show that working with standard technology and existing sentiment analysis approaches is a viable approach to sentiment analysis within a multilingual framework.},

We have used machine learning algorithms like Na ve Bayes and SVM to find phrase level polarity and then combine them incorporating the effects of the conjunctions to get the overall polarity of the sentence. We use word dependencies and dependency trees to analyze the sentence constructs and were able to get results close to 93\%. Opportunities for the improvement of the sentiment extraction and subject identification methods are also discussed.},

abstract = {We examine the problem of predicting local sentiment flow in documents, and its application to several areas of text analysis. Formally, the problem is stated as predicting an ordinal sequence based on a sequence of word sets. In the spirit of isotonic regression, we develop a variant of conditional random fields that is better suited to handle this problem. Experiments are reported for both sentiment prediction and text summarization, showing the possibility of incorporating sentiment concept into a range of new applications.},

abstract = {The growing stream of content placed on the Web provides a huge collection of textual resources. People share their experiences on-line, ventilate their opinions (and frustrations), or simply talk just about anything. The large amount of available data creates opportunities for automatic mining and analysis. The information we are interested in this paper, is how people feel about certain topics. We consider it as a classification task: their feelings can be positive, negative or neutral. A sentiment isn’t always stated in a clear way in the text; it is often represented in subtle, complex ways. Besides direct expression of the user's feelings towards a certain topic, he or she can use a diverse range of other techniques to express his or her emotions. On top of that, authors may mix objective and subjective information about a topic, or write down thoughts about other topics than the one we are investigating. Lastly, the data gathered from the World Wide Web often contains a lot of noise. All of this makes the task of automatic recognition of the sentiment in on-line text more difficult. We will give an overview of various techniques used to tackle the problems in the domain of sentiment analysis, and add some of our own results.},

abstract = {This paper presents a parse-and-paraphrase paradigm to assess the degrees of sentiment for product reviews. Sentiment identification has been well studied; however, most previous work provides binary polarities only (positive and negative), and the polarity of sentiment is simply reversed when a negation is detected. The extraction of lexical features such as unigram/bigram also complicates the sentiment classification task, as linguistic structure such as implicit long-distance dependency is often disregarded. In this paper, we propose an approach to extracting adverb-adjective-noun phrases based on clause structure obtained by parsing sentences into a hierarchical representation. We also propose a robust general solution for modeling the contribution of adverbials and negation to the score for degree of sentiment. In an application involving extracting aspect-based pros and cons from restaurant reviews, we obtained a 45\% relative improvement in recall through the use of parsing methods, while also improving precision.},

@inproceedings{Ponte+Croft:98a,
abstract = {Models of document indexing and document retrieval have been extensively studied. The integration of these two classes of models has been the goal of several researchers but it is a very difficult problem. We argue that much of the reason for this is the lack of an adequate indexing model. This suggests that perhaps a better indexing model would help solve the problem. However, we feel that making unwarranted parametric assumptions will not lead to better retrieval performance. Furthermore, making prior assumptions about the similarity of documents is not warranted either. Instead, we propose an approach to retrieval based on probabilistic language modeling. We estimate models for each document individually. Our approach to modeling is non-parametric and integrates document indexing and document retrieval into a single model. One advantage of our approach is that collection statistics which are used heuristically in many other retrieval models are an integral part of our model. We have implemented our model and tested it empirically. Our approach significantly outperforms standard tf.idf weighting on two different collections and query sets.},

@article{Argamon2009,
abstract = {Recent work in sentiment analysis has begun to apply fine-grained semantic distinctions between expressions of attitude as features for textual analysis. Such methods, however, require the construction of large and complex lexicons, giving values for multiple sentiment-related attributes to many different lexical items. For example, a key attribute is what type of attitude is expressed by a lexical item; e.g., beautiful expresses appreciation of an objects quality, while evil expresses a negative judgment of social behavior. In this chapter we describe a method for the automatic determination of complex sentiment-related attributes such as attitude type and force, by applying supervised learning to WordNet glosses. Experimental results show that the method achieves good effectiveness, and is therefore well-suited to contexts in which these lexicons need to be generated from scratch.},

abstract = {We propose and evaluate a method for automatically creating a reference corpus for training text classification procedures for mining political opinions in user-generated content. The process starts by compiling a collection of highly opinionated comments posted by users on an on-line newspaper. Then, we define and use a set of manually-crafted high-precision rules supported by a large sentiment-lexicon in order to identify sentences in each comment expressing opinions about political entities. Finally, the opinions found are propagated to the remainder sentences of the comment mentioning the same entities, thus increasing the number and variety of opinion-bearing sentences. Results show that most of the rules can identify negative opinions with very high precision, and these can be safely propagated to the remainder sentences in the comment in almost 100\% of the cases. Due to problems arising from irony, the precision of identification drops for positive opinions, but several rules still reach high precision. Propagation of positive opinions is correct in about 77\% of the cases, and most errors at this stage result from irony and polarity inversion throughout the comment.},

@misc{Esuli2007,
abstract = {Opinion mining (OM) is a recent subdiscipline at the crossroads of information retrieval and computational linguistics which is concerned not with the topic a document is about, but with the opinions it expresses. OM has a rich set of applications, ranging from tracking users’ opinions about products or about political candidates as expressed in online forums, to customer relationship management. In order to aid the extraction of opinions from text, recent research has tried to automatically determine the “PN-polarity” of subjective terms, i.e. identify whether a term that indicates the presence of an opinion has a positive or a negative connotation. Research on determining the “SO-polarity” of terms, i.e. whether a term indeed indicates the presence of an opinion (a subjective term) or not (an objective, or neutral term) has been instead much scarcer. In this paper we describe SentiWordNet, a lexical resource produced by asking an automated classifier ˆ to associate to each synset s of WordNet (version 2.0) a triplet of scores ˆ(s, p) (for p 2 P =\{Positive, Negative, Objective\}) describing how strongly the terms contained in s enjoy each of the three properties. The method used to develop SentiWordNet is based on the quantitative analysis of the glosses associated to synsets, and on the use of the resulting vectorial term representations for semi-supervised synset classification. The score triplet is derived by combining the results produced by a committee of eight ternary classifiers, all characterized by similar accuracy levels but extremely different classification behaviour. We present the results of evaluating the accuracy of the automatically assigned triplets on a publicly available benchmark. SentiWordNet is freely available for research purposes, and is endowed with a Web-based graphical user interface.},
